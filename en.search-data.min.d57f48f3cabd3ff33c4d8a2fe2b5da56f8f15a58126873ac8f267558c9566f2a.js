It is a surprisingly comfortable seat and would be an excellent place to read, write or think if not for the proximity of the intersection of Hearst and Gayley. On its flat northern face is a plaque which reads \u0026ldquo;Founder\u0026rsquo;s Rock/April 16, 1860/Inscribed May 9, 1896.\u0026rdquo;\nUC Berkeley, California\u0026rsquo;s first university, is the great flagship of the mighty University of California. The rest of the fleet includes UCSF (1873), UCLA (1919), Davis (1922), UCSB (1944), Riverside (1954), UCSD (1964), Irvine (1965), and UCSC (1965). It started out as a humble teacher\u0026rsquo;s college, the Contra Costa Academy. In 1855 it changed its name to the College of California and moved to Oakland, the block bounded by 12th Street, 14th Street, Franklin and Harrison, now a city parking lot. The college had chosen a new site, 160 acres north of Oakland, and obtained the required land by 1864, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have the funds to build a new campus until it combined with the \u0026ldquo;Agricultural, Mining and Mechanic Arts College\u0026rdquo; the State Congress authorized in 1866 under the Morill Act. The resulting University of California opened in 1869 but remained at its Oakland site until the completion of North and South Halls in 1873, the year of its first graduating class, known as the Twelve Apostles.\nBoth the new University and the town incorporated nine years later were named after George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, who had visited Rhode Island in 1729 to found a university in Bermuda for colonials\nand Native Americans. In An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision (1709), Berkeley postulated that matter does not exist, an idea Samuel Johnson refuted by kicking a rock. Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s most famous epigram, \u0026ldquo;esse est percipi,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to be is to be perceived,\u0026rdquo; could be engraved over any of several of Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s coffee houses. His name was probably chosen, however, for the last verse of \u0026ldquo;on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America\u0026rdquo;:\n Westward the course of Empire takes its way;\nThe first four acts already past,\nA fifth shall close the drama with the day:\nTime\u0026rsquo;s noblest offspring is the last.\n which college trustee Frederick Billings apparently thought very moving and apposite.\nOur alumni include Ed Meese, Earl Warren, Robert Macnamara, Jerry Brown, Gregory Peck, George Takei, Melvin Belli (who also appeared in Star Trek), Timothy Leary, Rube Goldberg, Steve Wozniak, and Steven Jobs, as well as former presidents of Mexico, Ecuador, and Columbia. Some of our more famous dropouts include William R. Hearst, Jr., Stephen D. Bechtel, Pauline Kael, Jack London and Art Agnos. Olivia de Havilland and Mickey Rooney began their careers here in Max Reinhart\u0026rsquo;s 1934 production of \u0026ldquo;A Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream\u0026rdquo; in Faculty Glade. Berkeley’s denizens have also included, according to Cal enthusiast Tom Collins, \u0026ldquo;an Amazon Rain God and the head of Mongolian Buddhism, as well as the guy who invented fruit cocktail.\u0026rdquo;\nBerkeley has entertained five American presidents\u0026ndash;Howard Taft (who spoke in Faculty Glade before setting off for the Phillipines), Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman, and John F. Kennedy, who drew his largest live audience ever at the Greek Theater. Jawarlal Nehru, U Thant, and Prince Philip, among others, have visited the campus, and I heard Mary Robinson, the President of Ireland, speak at Zellerbach in 1991. Sarah Bernhardt performed Phaedra at the Greek Theater in 1906, when her theater in San Francisco was destroyed by the earthquake; Pablo Casals taught a graduate seminar here in 1960. A long list of scientific notables have also lectured and taught here; I heard Stephen Hawking lecture while he was attending a conference here in 1992.\nDuring the first commencement exercises in 1873, North and South Halls were still under construction; the sound of hammers punctuated University President Daniel Coit Gilman\u0026rsquo;s speech. That sound has been heard on campus ever since; people today say that \u0026ldquo;UC\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;under construction.\u0026rdquo; Walking to Founder\u0026rsquo;s Rock this morning I had to circle around the center of campus, where the front steps of Doe Library, a meadow and several temporary wooden buildings left over from World War II had been replaced by dirt and construction equipment. Nowhere, not even the Eucalyptus Grove, is quiet\u0026ndash;the sound of backup alarms penetrates everywhere.\nI received my B.A. here in 1985, and my M.S. in 1987, and already so much has changed. I can\u0026rsquo;t keep track of the new buildings, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I don\u0026rsquo;t notice all we\u0026rsquo;ve lost (like Humphrey GoBART or the Onyx Room). In one sense this book was dated before it was begun\u0026ndash;in another there maybe no time like now to record the existing campus before too much more disappears.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/guide/history-and-development/','title':"History \u0026 Development",'section':"The Guide",'content':"This University is nearly a century and a half old\u0026mdash;-not long by European or even American standards, but mature for the West Coast. Although the Society of Jesus founded Santa Clara College, now the University of Santa Clara, in 1851, it was not chartered until 185, after the College of California, now the University of California, was incorporated. Stanford, founded in 1891, is a baby by comparison. This is why it is known as the \u0026ldquo;junior university\u0026rdquo;; it still believes that someday it will catch up.\nSouth Hall, the oldest existing building on campus, was, as the gilt letters over the entrance proclaim, built in 1873. It and North Hall were set on a graded hill and in old pictures they appear to be the only buildings for miles. This building was designed by David Farquharson, the University’s second planner, and originally contained the university offices and the agriculture department-hence the panels on the north and south sides depicting produce and the plant motifs on the central staircase. The building later became the College of Commerce when a new agriculture building was built in 1888. Professor Yale Braunstein, who disappointingly did not mention this manuscript when acknowledging his sources at his Cal Day lecture in 2003, pointed out that the building had originally faced the bay, but the entrance was moved to the east side of the building when Wheeler Hall was built right up against it in 1918. Apparently John Galen Howard, the campus architect at the time, had it in for South Hall and had intended to demolish it. It escaped demolition at Howard’s hands, and later narrowly escaped burning down in 1934, when a careless painter\u0026rsquo;s blowtorch ignited the vines on the walls, and being torn down in 1967, when one administrator referred to it as a \u0026ldquo;crummy old building\u0026rdquo;; unfortunately it did not escape the addition of an ugly annex in 1913 or interior renovation in1968, in which the large rooms on the second and third floors were partitioned (several now have only half a window, and in some cases are taller than they are long or wide).Only the central staircase and wainscoting are original. The ivy that covered the building until a few years ago had been planted around the turn of the century by the 17 women of the class of 1874, the first women to graduate from Berkeley. More information on this building and its history, including some lovely historic photos (check out Blue and Gold) can be found on the Schoolof Information Management and Systems site. Unfortunately, this page doesn’t describe Dr. Braunstein’s story of the Phantom Typist, his exhaustive comparison of the roof of South Hall and the scene of the chimney sweeps’ dance in \u0026ldquo;Mary Poppins,\u0026rdquo; or his discovery that South Hall appears in the novel Murder on the Air.\nNorth Hall was a four story wood building similar in style to South Hall, originally white but soon painted brown with white trim, with two entrances and sets of steps in the front. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that this building was named after Arthur W. North, class of 1895, explorer of the Canadian bush, journalist, and track star, but has he had not yet been born when the building was built, this is unlikely. North Hall housed the administrative offices of University Presidents from Gilman to Wheeler, the ASUC store (known as the Joint), the women\u0026rsquo;s club, and University publications. It was the center of student life; the Glee Club sang on the front steps, and senior men congregated on the southeast steps, near the Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Bench, to discuss pressing issues of the day.\nThe building was condemned in 1914 as a \u0026ldquo;fire hazard\u0026rdquo; to the new Doe Library next door. It was ceremonially destroyed on May 16, 1917, the only campus building to be demolished in a respectful manner. The roofed-over basement which remained was used as the ASUC store until 1923; it was then used as emergency classrooms and the Naval Unit Headquarters until 1931 when it was finally filled in. The only reminder of North Hall now is a plaque on the south steps of Doe Library.\nNorth Hall did not disappear immediately from campus life, however. As late as1941, all the gavels used on campus were made from its banisters. Its bell, installed in 1873 and removed after Bacon Hall was built, was lost sometime between 1910 and1922. After looking everywhere, including the Stanford campus, someone finally found it in the zoology vertebrate museum (I\u0026rsquo;d hate to think who classified it). Students used to try to steal its clapper every year, including those well known juvenile delinquents Robert Gordon Sproul and Joseph LeConte.\nNorth and South Halls were sited on a plan designed by Frederick Law Olmstead (who had also designed New York\u0026rsquo;s Central Park and our own Golden Gate Park) when the College of California first obtained the Berkeley site in 1864. Olmstead described the site as \u0026ldquo;empty scenery and no view,\u0026rdquo; and envisioned an idyllic, park-likesetting for scholarly contemplation, far from Oakland or San Francisco. (Remember, this whole area was little more than wilderness until well after the turn of the century. The first University librarian recalled looking out the window of Bacon Hall and seeing only two white farmhouses in the distance. Berkeley did not even exist as a city until 1878. The Claremont Hotel, built in 1915, was a rural resort.)The campus was to be oriented toward the ocean and the Golden Gate (the bridge across which would not be built for another 73 years).\nThe major drawback of Olmstead\u0026rsquo;s plan was that it only had two buildings. With the addition of a third, Bacon Hall, a new plan was needed. In 1870 the Regents commissioned a plan from San Francisco architect David Farquarson who, in order to provide for the indefinite future needs of a growing university, magnanimously envisioned six buildings. His plan created a long axis starting from the central court (where the Campanile is now) and stretching southwest. He designed North and South Halls to suit this plan. An 1875 watershed map shows sites for North, South and Bacon Halls and dorms near Allston Street. A museum (where Cory Hall is now), School of Mines (near the engineering complex), Conservatory (where the agricultural complex is now),nursery (where Haviland Hall is now), horticulture building (where Hilgard Hall is now), Assembly Hall (where Dwinelle Hall is now) and an unspecified building (near where Stanley Hall is now) were all proposed.\nBacon Hall was completed in 1881 and stood where Birge Hall is now. Henry Douglas Bacon, a banker and investor from St. Louis, donated his library and art collection to the University as well as $25,000 toward a building in which to house them. Bacon was an abolitionist and admirer of Abraham Lincoln. He commissioned a marble statue entitled \u0026ldquo;The Abolition of Slavery,\u0026rdquo; a life sized Columbia standing over a nude slave girl, as a gift for the President; when Lincoln was assassinated the statue ended up here. Its last known whereabouts was the basement of Hearst Gym. One wonders how well Bacon got along with the many ex-Confederates at Berkeley, including University President John LeConte.\nBacon\u0026rsquo;s art collection occupied the top floor of the new building under a glass ceiling. The library below was very elegant, with easy chairs, glassed-in cases, and lovely curving ironwork balconies. After the library was moved to Doe Library in 1912, geology, paleontology and geography moved into the building, and the art gallery became a rock collection. Geography moved out in 1921; paleontology moved to the Hearst Mining building in the mid-1930s. The clock tower was removed in 1929 when the Regents grew concerned that it might fall through the glass ceiling in an earthquake, and the building was finally demolished in 1964. The clock mechanism, originally donated by a Regent, later became part of the clockwork in the Campanile.\nFor more than a decade I believed that the cupola in the courtyard of the chemistry complex had been part of Bacon Hall. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of the old Chemistry Building, an enormous college-Gothic structure built in 1891 and demolished in 1959.The cupola, which stands where the building once stood, commemorates the famous scientists who had worked under it. It has recently been repainted, reglassed, and labeled so that future students won\u0026rsquo;t make the same mistake I did.\nOlmstead was not pleased with the university\u0026rsquo;s new look. Obviously not considering Berkeley one of his successes, he went on to design Stanford. In a letter to Leland Stanford in 1886 he said, \u0026ldquo;One of the largest of the college buildings at Amherst\u0026hellip;has been lately taken down, as an offense to good taste\u0026hellip;the same experience will, probably, by and by occur at Berkeley on a larger scale.\u0026rdquo; In 1887 he referred to the five academic buildings \u0026mdash; North, South, and Bacon Halls, Harmon Gym (not the one we know now, but a small, beautiful octagonal carpenter Gothic structure with rose windows over the doors, which stood where Dwinelle Plaza is now and served as auditorium and theater as well as gym), Mechanical Arts (similar to North and South Halls in style, but tall and skinny, of dark brick with white details) \u0026mdash; and eight dormitory cottages along Strawberry Creek as \u0026ldquo;cheap and nasty.\u0026rdquo;\nThe 1890s saw a construction boom, starting with the Chemistry Building in 1891.Mining and Civil Engineering, where Davis Hall is now, was built in 1893, and the Conservatory, a duplicate of the one in Golden Gate Park, in 1894 (this structure, southeast of where Haviland Hall is now, was torn down in 1924, when the botanical gardens were moved to Strawberry Canyon). In 1895 Budd Hall, named after Governor James H. Budd, one of the Twelve Apostles, was constructed where Moses Hall is now, on the foundation of the first Agriculture Building, which had been built in 1888and later burned down. Budd Hall was designed for agriculture, but also housed physics, biochemistry, and viticulture (the University had a wine cellar here until 1918).It was a red brick and wood building, soon covered, appropriately, with vines. It was finally demolished in 1933, displacing its sole remaining occupant, an engineer named E.H. Hoff, who had been there since 1908, and UC Davis now houses the University\u0026rsquo;s viticulture department. There was, incidentally, an East Hall, built for zoology in 1898, where LeConte Hall is now. It was moved to the site of Morrison Hall in1921, and demolished in 1942, after zoology had moved to LSB.\nBy the turn of the century, with ten major buildings the campus had again outgrown its plan. In the 1890s a few began to whisper that the University of California was not as attractive as that new university across the Bay, and an ordered, gracious environment like the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exhibition\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;White City\u0026rdquo; was every American\u0026rsquo;s dream. Bernard Maybeck, at the time a drawing instructor, pointed out the need for a new plan to Regent Jacob B. Reinstein, an Apostle. He explained the situation to Phoebe Apperson Hearst, who agreed to put up $100,000 towards an international competition for the University\u0026rsquo;s first Comprehensive Building Plan in 1900, \u0026ldquo;one of the most lavish competitions in the history of architecture,\u0026rdquo; according to Bernard Maybeck\u0026rsquo;s daughter in law Jacomena.\nThe rules of the competition exhorted the entrants to ignore existing buildings and start over. They called for 28 buildings, including dormitories for 1,500 men and women; a list of the buildings including required sizes and capacities was provided. Olmstead had envisioned a sort of organic process in which each college grew naturally and separately, and the buildings did not relate to each other; in contrast to this, the competition specifically directed designers to view the University as a whole and plan for decades (if not centuries) into the future.\nThe 98 entries were evaluated by Reinstein and four architects from London, Paris, Dresden, and New York. In Antwerp the 98 were narrowed down to 11 entries from Europe and New York, more detailed and improved versions of which were exhibited in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. Each designer emphasized different aspects of campus life\u0026mdash;dorms, arenas, classrooms and open space were given different priorities indifferent plans. The first six winners were neoclassical; it is not until the seventh place plan that such romantic conceits as woods and winding paths appear. The first six entries disregarded the fact that the site is a valley-all but one (in which the central campus was left natural and open) involved levelling the site. The difference between the higherranking plans and the others is the presence of an east-west axis. The lower-rated plans included north-south axes, and often had no east-west axis. The third place plan was fan-shaped, with the point at the west gate. Its buildings were long and skinny and oriented north to south, as well as cupped around the site. The fourth place plan, prepared by John Galen Howard, who was eventually hired as Supervising Architect, arranged dorms on Charter Hill like rays around a central stair (he later aligned them along a curving road; the idea of reserving the hill for dorms was one of the best that came out of the competition, and it is a shame we did not act on it).\nThe $10,000 first prize and the job of Supervising Architect went to Henri Jean Emile Benard of Paris. His plan was distinguished from the others in that his east-west axis included a square, treelined esplanade and formal garden, instead of a long boring axis with buildings set at monotonous intervals along it. His plan contained many different sizes and shapes of buildings, with domes, courts, towers and different roof styles, instead of rows of buildings of the same size and shape. His plan made elegant use of Charter Hill, with stairs and buildings working their way up to a monument at the top. Moreover, unlike most of the other plans, and unlike the campus today, it afforded a view of the hill from strategic points in the central campus. Like the other plans, Benard favored a formal instead of topographical layout. He and Howard both left the southwest corner of the site (where Harmon Gym, Evans Field and Edwards Stadium are today) as forest.\nBenard visited Berkeley to collect his money and put the finishing touches on his masterpiece; his \u0026ldquo;difficult personality,\u0026rdquo; lack of English, and disappointment at the probable outcome of his grand plan (it would have cost $80 million\u0026mdash;the Regents had less than $1 million to spend) were probably why he declined the job of Supervising Architect and proceeded to Mexico City, where he spent the next ten years before returning to France and thus dropping out of our history.\nThe Regents then decided to hire the fourth place winner, John Galen Howard of New York. Howard was an Easterner, born in Massachusetts and educated at MIT. After working for H.H. Richardson and McKim, Mead and White, he obtained an architecture degree from the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and at the time of the competition had been a partner in Howard and Cauldwell of New York for about five years. His plan was similar to Benard\u0026rsquo;s, though more rigid and less inspired. It was greeted with such epithets as \u0026ldquo;pretentious\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;un-American,\u0026rdquo; but turned out far better than we had any reason to expect.\nShowing a fitting sense of priorities, the first structure begun under the new plan, and the only Benard building erected on campus, was University House, started in 1900 but not finished until 1907 and not occupied until Benjamin Ide Wheeler moved in in 1911. The supervising architect was Albert Pissis (who also designed San Francisco\u0026rsquo;s Emporium Building and the well-known San Francisco Mechanics Institute built in 1909);Howard did the interiors. Chancellors resided there until 1958, when Clark Kerr broke with tradition by staying in his house in El Cerrito. Chancellor Chang-Ling Tien and his wife currently occupy the house. This building was the first to step over the boundaries of the original campus between the forks of Strawberry Creek.\nThe Greek Theater was the first Howard building to be completed (at least, as much as it ever was\u0026mdash;Howard had originally planned a ring of karyatids around the structure, which was to have been faced in marble). The site, known as Ben Weed\u0026rsquo;s Amphitheater after the student who discovered its acoustic properties, had been used for performances \u0026ldquo;in the rough\u0026rdquo; for at least 20 years. Howard\u0026rsquo;s model was the theater at Epidaurus, with few Roman elements thrown in. Its opening was celebrated with a performance of Aristophanes' The Birds, in Greek. The first two rows of seats in the theater have \u0026ldquo;Hearst\u0026rdquo; written on the back\u0026mdash;they are reserved for the family.\nAlthough the Regents had declared Benard\u0026rsquo;s plan \u0026ldquo;permanent\u0026rdquo; in 1900,Howard merrily altered it to suit himself. His changes allowed for less excavation and embankment, and more work with the natural contours of the site. He rearranged the formal east-west axis to slant toward the Golden Gate and the existing street plan of Berkeley, and deleted several of Benard\u0026rsquo;s street links (especially to Telegraph, which was originally to have bisected the campus) because he felt that the University should be more isolated. In 1908 Howard officially submitted a revised plan, which became known as the Phoebe Hearst Plan. Under this plan, with Howard as Supervising Architect, the classical core of the campus took shape.\nThe memorial to Howard before the entrance of the Campanile lists his work: the Greek Theater, Hearst Mining, Doe Library, Boalt Hall (now Durant), Agricultural Hall (now Wellman), Sather Tower and the Esplanade, Hilgard Hall, Wheeler Hall, Gilman Hall, Stephens Hall, Haviland Hall, LeConte Hall, Hesse Hall. He also built vernacular structures of wood, like Naval Architecture (formerly the Drawing Office) and NorthGate Hall (formerly \u0026ldquo;The Ark\u0026rdquo;; Howard, as Supervising Architect, was \u0026ldquo;Father Noah\u0026rdquo;). I had heard that these buildings were \u0026ldquo;temporaries,\u0026rdquo; but Paul Brentano of the history department says they were built of wood to represent connections to the community beyond the University, a concern spurred by the city\u0026rsquo;s rapid growth. Although in a 1914 plan building were oriented toward the interior rather than the periphery of the campus, in the late 1910s Howard began to acknowledge the city. Hilgard Hall (1918), for example, attempted to face both inward and outward at once.\nWhen Phoebe Hearst died and President Wheeler retired in 1919, Howard found himself dealing directly with the Regents. He had always insisted on complete control of campus design, as well as the sole right to design campus buildings; this the Regents were no longer willing to grant him. In 1922 they awarded the design of the new Hearst Gym to Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan while Howard was in Europe. This building, and the attached buildings and grounds originally planned, were the seed of a \u0026ldquo;revolt\u0026rdquo; organized by Bernard Maybeck, Julia Morgan and William Randolph Hearst, whose memorial gym for his mother had originally been intended as the nucleus of a \u0026ldquo;countercampus\u0026rdquo; in the style of San Simeon. Unfortunately the Depression intervened and these plans were never realized.\nThe deciding battle, however, was over the location of Memorial Stadium, built in 1923 at the head of Strawberry Canyon in a bird and wildflower sanctuary. Strawberry Creek was rerouted and piped under the stadium, and fill for levelling was dug from the side of Charter Hill (today, after further desecration, known as Cyclotron Hill).Howard thought this loss to the campus environment would be too great, preferring the site where Evans Field was eventually built in 1930, but he was overruled. By1923, after several veiled threats and offers to resign his contract as Supervising Architect was not renewed and he retired from his position as Dean of the Architecture School.\nThe Regents then hired George Kelham as Supervising Architect; he served from1927 to 1936. He had impeccable Beaux Arts credentials, having designed the San Francisco Public Library in 1916 and the original Bank of America Building in San Francisco (across the street from the current \u0026ldquo;Bank of America Building\u0026rdquo; which no longer houses the headquarters of the B of A). Under his direction Harmon Gym and Moses, McLaughlin, Bowles and Gianini Halls were built (he designed all but the last, which was done by William C. Hays) as well as LSB\u0026mdash;at three acres, the world\u0026rsquo;s largest academic structure when built. The ornamentation on this building is similar to the shells on his Shell Building, 100 Bush Street in San Francisco, which he designed in 1929. Kelham also designed International House, built in 1930.\nArthur Brown, Jr. became Supervising Architect in 1938. He was an excellent choice, with many fine buildings in the City to his credit\u0026mdash;Temple Emanu-El, City Hall (1915),the Opera House (1932), Coit Tower (1934), and the glorious Transbay Transit Terminal(1937). During the austere Depression and war years, he tried to maintain the \u0026ldquo;Howard look\u0026rdquo; but the University just couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford it; thus such halfhearted efforts as Sproul, Lewis, and Minor Halls and the Bancroft Library. He devised a new plan in 1944 which created, among other things, a minor north-south axis around Hearst Mining and called for a four-story limit on campus structures (to keep from building all over the available space he planned a series of long, low structures around the campus perimeter). He resigned in 1948, probably over his design for Stanford\u0026rsquo;s Hoover Tower in 1941.\nAfter World War II the population of California exploded and, thanks to the GI Bill, so did enrollment\u0026mdash;to 47,000 students by 1958, a figure that was then expected to triple by 1978. Construction bonds were passed in 1956, 1958, 1962 and 1964. After a temporary stint with the Office of Architects and Engineers, the Regents, apparently giving up on Supervising Architects, formed the Committee on Campus Planning in 1955.This committee consists of 20 to 25 people appointed by the Chancellor\u0026mdash;faculty, students and representatives of other campus communities. In 1956 this committee unveiled the first Long Range Development Plan, which stated among other things that only 25% of the campus area could be built on and that cars would be considered the \u0026ldquo;principal means of access\u0026rdquo; to campus. Under this plan academic buildings would be built at the campus center and support services on the perimeter, and buildings would be arranged in disciplinary \u0026ldquo;complexes\u0026rdquo;; neither of these provisions lasted long after Tolman Hall, a building housing psychology and education classrooms, was built in 1962 in the northwest corner of campus in the bioscience area.\nMany old buildings were demolished during this period, and many important spaces, like Observatory Hill and Central Glade, were built over. A new Long Range Development Plan was released in 1962\u0026mdash;it was more sensitive to the campus environment, acknowledged alternative means of transportation, included landscaping work, and considered outlying areas such as Cyclotron Hill as well as the central campus. It did not, however, represent a major philosophical change. Clark Kerr (class of \u0026lsquo;39), then Chancellor, published his famous \u0026ldquo;multiversity\u0026rdquo; essay in 1963, which justified the breakup of the university into separate worlds with no community or connection. It also implicitly justified the different \u0026ldquo;functional\u0026rdquo; buildings of the \u0026lsquo;50sand \u0026rsquo;60s, monster blocks with rows and rows of doors leading to isolated rooms. The very next year Wurster Hall, the epitome of anomie, as it were, was completed.\nThis sort of thing could not be stood for long without some kind of reaction. In 1965 Allan Temko, a member of the Center for Planning and Development Research, criticized the fortresslike aspect of the southeast gate\u0026mdash;Boalt, Kroeber and Wurster Halls. In 1967 the Commission on University Governance released a paper on the University\u0026rsquo;s building plan, criticizing the University for its lack of imagination in dealing with student housing, its favoritism toward hard science, its inability to foster community, and the its unwillingness to hold the planning department accountable for its decisions. The report stressed the importance of the campus environment and its powerful effect on the quality of education the University provides.\nConfrontations in the mid-1970s broke out over the slated destruction of the Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Club and the Naval Architecture building. The Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Club, formerly Golden Bear Lodge, and now officially called Senior Hall, was the first campus building to be built with student donations. It was scheduled for dismantling and storage in 1973 in order to expand the Men\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club, but the Friends of Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Hall, and their lawyer, were able to stop the demolition because an environmental impact document had not been prepared. Naval Architecture, one of Howard\u0026rsquo;s wood buildings, built in 1914 and partly demolished in 1967 to make room for the Davis Hall annex, was left in peace in 1976 after a battle over the siting of the Bechtel Engineering Center, and placed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks in 1977.\nThe Campus Planning Study Group\u0026rsquo;s survey of historic resources in 1978 nominated historic buildings and spaces for the National Register; many were placed on the Register in 1982. Using the results of the survey, design studies were prepared in1979 to propose ways to enhance and protect the campus environment. The 1970s and \u0026rsquo;80s were relatively slow years for campus construction, as most of the University\u0026rsquo;s growth in these years took place off the original campus.\nThe 1962 Master Plan was finally replaced in 1989 with a plan that purports to be concerned with the campus environment, historic preservation, and open space. Although the plan calls for a reduction in campus enrollment and includes restoration of Wellman Court and what\u0026rsquo;s left of Central Glade (which includes both the Doe Extension and a new Student Services Center), it also includes additions to most of the buildings on the southeast campus. New laws ensure public review and comment, as well as sensitivity to environmental and community issues. Despite this new sensitivity, several new buildings have been erected in the past few years, including RSF, LSB Annex, and the Northwest Animal Facility. While they are of higher quality than most of the buildings built after World War II, they are intrusive and use up valuable open space.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/guide/existing-campus/','title':"The Existing Campus",'section':"The Guide",'content':"Concordance of Building Names (or, Which Moses was Moses Hall Named After?) #  Academic buildings #   Anthony (1957) Earle C., Los Angeles-based dealer of Packard cars, and the world’s prominent Packard dealer. He owned a radio station and several showrooms, introduced neon signage to the US, was the first to put a gasoline pump at the curb for quickstop fuel purchases, and was instrumental in encouraging the building of the Golden Gate Bridge to promote driving and car sales (thanks to John Hempel and to George Hamlin, Vice President and International Liaison of the Packard Club, for educating me on this subject). John Hempel, professor of biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, also supplied the following story:  The one interesting story about Anthony that I recall is that at some point in the 1930\u0026rsquo;s he instructed an associate to go to the bank and withdraw one million dollars. The associate did so, Anthony put the money in a briefcase and disappeared. The associate became extremely concerned. Not too long afterward, Anthony reappeared, handing the money back with instructions to redeposit it. \u0026ldquo;What was this all about?\u0026rdquo;, the associate asked? Simple. \u0026ldquo;Ever since I was a kid I wondered what it would be like to walk down the street with a million dollars.\u0026rdquo; was the reply.\n In addition to all this, Anthony was notable in Berkeley history as the first editor of the Pelican, Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s humor magazine; the name was 1920s slang for \u0026ldquo;wallflower\u0026rdquo;. He donated the money for the building and supplied the bird himself. He\u0026rsquo;d been pleased with the work Bernard Maybeck had done for him here and in Los Angeles, and had originally wanted Maybeck to do the design, but the architect had retired\u0026ndash;he agreed, however, to serve as consultant to Joseph Esherick. The building is now graduate offices; Pelican staff have sworn to take it back. And the mystery of the Packard hood ornament (is that really a pelican on the front of that car?) still remains.\n Bancroft Library (1949) Hubert Howe, California historian. His bust is in the library. The Bancroft Collection is based on materials he gathered for his 39 volume history of western North America, a copy of which my high school American history teacher owned but fortunately did not make us read. Barker (1964) Horace Albert, biochemist specializing in metabolism, 1960s. This building was designed by William Wurster. Barrows (1964) David Prescott, political science professor, University President, 1919- 1923, international traveller, noted scholar. He announced to his class in the 1930s that another war was impossible. A man of vision, obviously. A couple of Barrowsisms: overheard on opening day\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s much nicer from the inside looking out.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It would have to be.\u0026rdquo; Graffito on fence around construction site\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;Sonny Liston designed Barrows Hall with his gloves on.\u0026rdquo; Bechtel (1980) Stephen Davison, Sr. \u0026ldquo;Attended\u0026rdquo; Berkeley in 1919, and was later given an honorary degree in 1954. He started a construction company in 1919 with his father, W. A. Bechtel, whichw as part of the \u0026ldquo;Six Companies\u0026rdquo; consortium which built Hoover Dam, it later became the Bechtel engineering empire. The building was built with $6.3 million in private donations. Birge (1964) Raymond Thayer, physics professor since 1918, physics chair 1933-1955. The building was named in 1963, when Birge was 76. The glass walkways have hawk silhouettes on them not for ornament but to scare birds so they won\u0026rsquo;t fly into the glass. Boalt (1951) Original name of Durant Hall. Mrs. Boalt gave $100,000 in memory of her husband, Judge John Henry, and 40 state lawyers and judges contributed to make it the \u0026ldquo;best law school west of the Rockies.\u0026rdquo; Callaghan (1947) Admiral Daniel Judson, professor of naval science. Killed on the bridge of the USS San Francisco in the Battle for the Solomons in 1942. International House was called Callaghan Hall during the war. Calvin (1963) Melvin, molecular biology professor, winner of the 1961 Nobel Prize for work on photosynthesis. He designed a round lab so that everyone\u0026rsquo;s office would open onto a central room, thus generating creative interaction. This is one of several buildings on campus that students have paid for with their taxes and registration fees but are not allowed to enter. Campbell (1959) William Wallace, professor of astronomy and director of Lick Observatory. University President, 1923 to 1930. Cory (1950) Clarence L., Dean of the College of Mechanics, faculty member for almost 40 years. May I commend his picture to you\u0026ndash;he was a very good looking young man. The first top floor was not completed until 1958; the second top floor was not completed until the mid-1980s. Davis (1931, 1967) Raymond E., engineering professor responsible for building the first engineering lab in 1931. This is the north part of the existing building, a mild-mannered attempt to harmonize with the Howard buildings; it\u0026rsquo;s the later Neobrutalist addition that springs to mind, however, when thinking of Davis. Note that the arches on the addition are meant to relate it to Hearst Mining. Doe (1910) Charles Edward. Came from Maine in 1857 as a schoolteacher, and made his fortune in California. He left a quarter of his estate to the University for construction of a new library, which the Regents decided to name after him. The card catalog room now boast the 24 by 15 foot \u0026ldquo;Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,\u0026rdquo; painted by Emanuel Leutze in 1854. It was discovered under the Hearst Gym pool in 1965, and was in the UAM in 1982, when my PoliSci 20 professor used it as a backdrop for a lecture on American pluralism. National Register, 1982. Donner (1942) William H., president of the Donner Steel Corporation. After his son died of cancer he formed the International Cancer Research Foundation, and donated funds to the University for work in nuclear medicine. The building\u0026rsquo;s construction superintendent was quoted as follows: \u0026ldquo;The building has been constructed mainly along utility lines, with comfort and sumptuousness de-emphasized.\u0026rdquo; Durant (1911) Henry, first University President, 1870-1872. He was born in Massachusetts and studied theology at Yale. He was a pastor before founding Contra Costa Academy in 1853. He served as its principal from 1853 to 1860, after which he taught Greek and philosophy until becoming the first President of the University of California in 1870. After resigning as University President he was elected mayor of Oakland twice before he died. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery. Henry\u0026rsquo;s on Durant Street is also named after him. This building was originally named Boalt; the law school was here until 1951 when the building was renamed. Now it houses Asiatic Studies. National Register, 1982. Dwinelle (1952) John Whipple, trustee of the College of California, chairman of the committee to write the University charter in 1868, member of the first Board of Regents. This was the largest classroom building in the world when constructed. Controversy abounded over how to pronounce the building\u0026rsquo;s name\u0026ndash;short I or long? Two or three syllables? The portrait which used to hang in the lobby showed Dwinelle clutching a bill which reads \u0026ldquo;University of Caifornia.\u0026rdquo; Of all the weird buildings on campus, this one is probably the most well known because virtually everyone has a class there sometime. Its combination of office and classroom space (not to mention the Durham Studio Theater stuck onto the back) leads to such oddities as going upstairs from the northwest entrance to the basement, or going down two floors to get from room 243 to room 3104. Try walking through the front door and straight to the back. DO NOT continue out the door\u0026mdash;you\u0026rsquo;re about three stories up at this point (the number of stories in the building varies with your position). What makes it even weirder is that everyone in there speaks a different language. In 1980 a folklore student gathered three explanations:\n The two brothers hired to design the building each did different sides; one died and the other had to carry on. The two architects fought and purposely designed their two sides differently. The two architects hated each other, and didn\u0026rsquo;t communicate during the design and construction of the building.  Go on\u0026ndash;give it a shot. Do some exploring. You may find something no one\u0026rsquo;s seen in years. Remember, if you get stuck just head for the nearest exit sign.\n Edwards (1932) Col. George C. One of the Twelve Apostles. Set survey stakes for North Hall. Math professor 1874 to 1918. According to the inscription engraved in the southwest wall of the stadium, he was \u0026ldquo;modest, kindly and selfless,\u0026rdquo; and an inspiration to his students. Eshleman (1965) John Morton, class of \u0026lsquo;02. First president of ASUC, editor of the Daily Cal and other local newspapers, California assembly member and lieutenant governor. Originally Eshleman was the Student Office Building (SOB) and Moses Hall was Eshleman Hall, which explains why Eshleman\u0026rsquo;s bust is in the library on the top floor of Eshleman and a plaque to him is near the entrance of Moses. Evans (1971) Griffith C. Math department chair 1934 to 1949. The building\u0026rsquo;s architect was Daniel Warner, who also designed its \u0026ldquo;Supergraphics.\u0026rdquo; He also presumably designed the main stairwell balcony that faces a concrete wall, eye level with a bare fluorescent light fixture. This building, Davis and Wurster are Neobrutalist, derived from the French word for \u0026ldquo;exposed concrete.\u0026rdquo; Before its completion, the Daily Cal printed an editorial entitled \u0026ldquo;Love can\u0026rsquo;t live in an ugly temple.\u0026rdquo; In addition to design and mechanical problems beginning Day 1 at \u0026ldquo;Fort Evans,\u0026rdquo; students began to paint and otherwise \u0026ldquo;adapt\u0026rdquo; the building. The \u0026ldquo;Death of Archimedes\u0026rdquo; and other unsanctioned artworks are worth checking out. Gianini (1930) Amadeo Peter, founder of the Bank of Italy which is now the Bank of America. An avid supporter of Mussolini, he \u0026ldquo;loaned\u0026rdquo; William Randolph Hearst, son of George and Phoebe (see below) a large sum of money to skew his newspapers and news service to favor the Fascists. He gave the University $1,500,000 for this building. His bust resides in a beautiful marble inset in the entry hall, before the split staircase that echoes the one outside the building (though without the decorative touch of bicycle wheels poking through the railings). Most of the details of this entry hall are Art Decostylized wheat sheafs in the iron railings and great lamps with raylike translucent panes. The ceiling is supported by rough-carved beams with patterns in silver, copper and primary colors. The entry lets in lots of light-it is open on three sides. Standing in it, you can see through to a nearby stairwell, and out a window in it to a tree outside. A portrait hangs on each side of the door, but as they are unlabeled I cannot enlighten you as to who they are. The rest of the building was remodeled 1963. National Register, 1982. Giaque (1954) William F., won Nobel Prize in 1949 for low temperature research. The wishbone staircase in front of this building is one of the few god things built on campus since World War II. Gilman (1917) Daniel Coit, professor of geology at Yale, University President, 1872 to 1875, founder of several colleges. In 1870 he was offered the job of University of California President after it was turned down by George McClellan, former Union General in Chief, who had lost the Presidency to Lincoln in 1864. Gilman at first also turned down the job, but accepted when asked again two years later after Henry Durant resigned. Gilman left Berkeley to become president of Johns Hopkins. In February 1941 plutonium was discovered in room 407A, which is on the National Register. The building has been recently added to. Girton (1912) Named for Girton College, Cambridge\u0026ndash;the first women\u0026rsquo;s college at a university in England. Julia Morgan (class of 1919) designed this building, originally the Senior Women\u0026rsquo;s Hall, now the campus childcare center. It was moved 160 feet west in 1946 to get it out of the way of the new intersection of Gayley and Piedmont. This building was paid for completely by University women. The senior women used to stage a ceremony at the end of each year, when they turned the building over to the juniors\u0026ndash; this custom had died out by the1940s. Harmon (1959) Albion Keith Paris Harmon, father in law of George C. Edwards (see above). The original Harmon Gym was built in 1879, added onto three times, and finally torn down in 1933 when the existing gym was built. The \u0026ldquo;Gym for Men\u0026rdquo; was named Harmon in 1959. Haviland (1924) J. T. H., San Francisco banker. The building was paid for by the bequest of his wife, Hannah Haviland, whose brother in law was Collis P. Huntington. Originally the School of Education (this is why there is a bust of Alexis F. Lange, then Dean of Education, in the lobby\u0026ndash;Lange is known for founding the junior college system in California). Its unaltered Howard interiors are some of the best on campus. National Register, 1982. Hearst Gym (1927) Phoebe Apperson, Regent, 1897 to 1919. She was a Midwestern schoolteacher who married miner and prospector George Hearst when she was 19. After a hard life prospecting in the West, she moved with him to California, where she sponsored a kindergarten with her husband\u0026rsquo;s wealth. She did the same in Washington, D.C., when George was elected senator from California. She went on to sponsor teacher training schools, libraries and scholarships. Her interest in archaeology led to her donations to Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s anthropology department and to her financial support of the Carter expedition that discovered Tutankhamon\u0026rsquo;s tomb. She eventually retired to a house in Pleasanton, where she lived until her death in the influenza epidemic of 1919. Her bust, and a plaque to George, can be found in the lobby of Hearst Mining. The gym was designed by Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan in collaboration with William Randolph Hearst, and originally planned to be much more elaborate and the center of a southern \u0026ldquo;counter campus.\u0026rdquo; The rumor that women swam in the central outdoor pool in the nude caused men as late as 1973 to attempt to see over the wall from the rooms on the higher floors of the south side of Barrows. National Register, 1982. Hearst Mining (1907) George, silver tycoon, senator, \u0026ldquo;a plain honest man and good miner.\u0026rdquo; Husband of Phoebe, and father of William Randolph, Sr. The six figures holding up the roof in front were sculpted by Robert Aitken, known for his work at the Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915, and represent the six lively arts. It\u0026rsquo;s said that, from left to right, they resemble George Hearst, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, Phoebe Hearst in younger days, John Galen Howard and Bernard Maybeck (with faces hidden). The cornerstone of this building contains medals, busts of the International Competition jurors, a portrait of George, and 100 shares of capital stock in the Hearst Mining Company, issued in 1869. The building was mostly completed when the earthquake of 1906 damaged it; repair and completion of the building was delayed as other buildings had priority, and the building stood vacant for more than a year. The lobby of this building is as fine an example of Early Victorian Engineer as you will find in the Western Hemisphere. The wall treatment is lovely, such details as railings and lamps are consistent with the style, and the south light is let in in a wonderfully creative way through windows around the front door, translucent ceiling domes, and those beautiful semicircular windows on the second floor. I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that portraits of people connected with the University should be taken there, with the sitter leaning against the sill, and the campus skyline framed in the background (perhaps the sitters could be positioned to block the view of Evans). The project engineer of the building\u0026rsquo;s seismic retrofit, Brendan Kelly, explained that although the hall\u0026rsquo;s general design is reminiscent of Paris\u0026rsquo; National Library, such unusual details as exposed girders and bare bulbs, and the huge ceiling skylights, make the room resemble a mine shaft. This building has an extraordinary number of chimneys around its perimeter; these were smelting furnaces for the materials labs housed in the building. The rest of the interior was unfortunately remodeled in 1948, but is now getting a major retrofit and sensitively designed improvement. National Register, 1982.\n Hertz (1958) Alfred, conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, 1915 to 1930. He was with the San Francisco Metropolitan Opera in 1906; he described the earthquake at that time as \u0026ldquo;something comparable to the mezzo forte roll on a cymbal or gong.\u0026rdquo; He left his estate to Berkeley for music. Hesse (1924) Frederick Godfrey, born in Prussia, was an engineer in the Prussian Army, came to Berkeley in 1875 and founded the College of Mechanics. Hildebrand (1966) Joel H., Dean of the College of Chemistry, 1949 to 1951. He and Gilbert Lewis led the \u0026ldquo;great faculty revolt\u0026rdquo; of 1919-1920, which resulted in more autonomy for faculty. He died in 1983 at the age of 101. His bust is in the Chemistry library in this building. Hilgard (1918) Eugene Woldemar. Born in Bavaria, worked for the Confederate Army during the Civil War finding saltpeter deposits to use for gunpowder. Professor of agriculture beginning in 1875. Proponent of \u0026ldquo;scientific agriculture.\u0026rdquo; Founded the University Agricultural Experimental Station, which later became UC Davis. The building was remodeled in 1963. Check out the beautiful Renaissance details on the east windows. National Register, 1982. Koshland (1991) Daniel, class of 1941, biochemistry professor, 1965 to present. Worked on the Manhattan Project. Kroeber (1959) Alfred, anthropology professor. The \u0026ldquo;K\u0026rdquo; in Ursula K. LeGuin stands for Kroeber\u0026ndash;he was her father. Allan Temko called Kroeber Hall schizophrenic\u0026ndash;it presents a different facade on each side. It actually isn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as some, though the sides bordered by the walkway and patio are certainly less finished. The area just north of the building has been used as an outdoor studio for art students since 1942; three mosaics from that era remain. Latimer (1962) Wendell M., dean of the College of Chemistry, 1941 to 1949. LeConte (1924) John and Joseph, professors of physics and geology. Native Georgians, they had taught at the University of South Carolina until the Civil War, during which they were superintendent and chemist of the Confederate powder works. After that debacle, they came to Berkeley in 1866. John was University President from 1877 to 1881. Both LeContes are commemorated with a plaque near an oak tree west of LSB; a memorial to Joseph was erected in Yosemite to honor his work as a naturalist and conservationist. Lewis (1948) Gilbert N., Dean of the College of Chemistry, 1912 to 1941. McLaughlin (1931) Donald Hamilton, class of 1914, professor at Harvard and Berkeley, Dean of Mining (1941-1943), Regent (1951-1967), and Peruvian gold mining tycoon. Friend of Howard and the Hearsts. Not afraid to speak his mind; he said, among other things, that Howard would have wanted Naval Architecture torn down to make room for the new engineering center. He may not have said that if he\u0026rsquo;d seen the design, as he also said of postwar campus architecture, \u0026ldquo;the buildings don\u0026rsquo;t have to be cheap, they just have to look cheap.\u0026rdquo; If anyone knows the significance of the symbol over the building\u0026rsquo;s east entrance, please call me. Memorial Stadium (1923) to students killed in World War I. Minor (1941) Ralph S., optometry professor 1903 to 1946, Dean of the School of Optometry. This building was originally a \u0026ldquo;defense\u0026rdquo; (i.e. war) building. Minor Annex was shoehorned into the available space in 1979. Moffitt (1968) James K., class of 1886, paper manufacturer, Regent, 1911 to 1948. This building was designed by John Warnecke, who is also responsible for the Units, Birge, Campbell and ESB. Morgan (1954) Agnes Fay, professor of nutrition 1915 to 1954. Her portrait hangs in the lobby. Nutrition studies are performed on the fourth floor, which is now \u0026ldquo;The Penthouse\u0026rdquo; but used to be the \u0026ldquo;Top of the Morg.\u0026rdquo; Morrison (1958) May Treat, class of 1878, who gave money in her will for this building. The Morrison Library in Doe is also named after her. Too bad she didn\u0026rsquo;t leave some for better pianos. Some tips on using the practice rooms in the basement: for pianists, get to know which rooms have playable pianos, as most are lousy, and ask for them. For nonpianists, ask for a room with a bad piano, so as not to deny a pianist the opportunity to play a good one. Moses (1931) Bernard, history professor 1876 to 1930. This building was formerly Eshleman Hall, offices of the Daily Cal: it was sold to the Regents in 1959, and renamed in 1964. It had also been known as Cleaver Hall, when students protested the administration\u0026rsquo;s decision not to allow Eldredge Cleaver to teach a course here. Mulford (1948) Walter, first Dean of the School of Forestry, 1914 to 1947. His portrait can be found in the building. This building was formerly Home Ec and Nutrition, but was renamed in 1956 and now houses the Department of Forestry and Conservation. Much of the interior is wood paneled; the parts that aren\u0026rsquo;t are covered with labeled planks, including some enormous Coast Redwood specimens. The planks on the first floor are native California woods, mostly donated by lumber companies. Those on the second are foreign species, most obtained after the Panama Pacific Exposition. In former days, the department exhibited the Tree of the Week in the lobby. O\u0026rsquo;Brien (1959) Morrough P., engineering professor, 1928 to 1948, Dean of Engineering, 1948 to 1959. Sather Tower and Gate Jane Krom, for Peder, \u0026lsquo;49er, banker (his bank, Sather and Church, was taken over by Bank of California at his death) and trustee of the College of California. Both structures were placed on the National Register in 1982. Senior (1906) This building is now officially called Senior Hall, though it was originally Golden Bear Lodge, then Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Hall. It is a beautifully designed log cabin originally used for student activities, including Senior Singing, and now used for various events. I had been told that this building had a secret entrance, but only recently have I discovered what it is, and where it leads. Sproul (1941) Robert Gordon, University Vice President and Comptroller, Secretary to the Regents, University President, 1930 to 1958. Born in San Francisco, he was the first native Californian to serve as University President. He was also the first Berkeley alumnus to occupy the position. After receiving his civil engineering degree in 1913, instead of practicing engineering he chose to stay at his alma mater, working his way up from cashier to President in 16 years. His bust is in the lobby. Sproul was apparently a character, well known for his booming voice. President Wheeler once asked his secretary what all the noise was, and was told that Mr. Sproul was talking to Sacramento. \u0026ldquo;Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t he use the telephone?\u0026rdquo; Wheeler asked. The building was originally known as Administration. Check out the display of historic photos on the first floor.\n Stanley (1952) Wendell M., winner of the 1946 Nobel Prize in chemistry for work on the chemical nature of virus particles, biochemistry chair 1948 to 1953, virology chair 1958 to 1964, founder and director of the virus lab 1948 to 1969. Also, according to the plaque near the south entrance, a \u0026ldquo;counsellor to students, and advocate of enlightened public policy for research in life sciences.\u0026rdquo; Stephens (1923) Henry Morse, professor and student advisor. The building was formerly the Student Union\u0026ndash;the second floor was the men\u0026rsquo;s club and bar, and the third floor was the women\u0026rsquo;s club. Student services offices and athletic offices were on the first floor. The ASUC sold the building to the Regents in 1964 to raise money for the new Student Union, and it was revamped for academic use. This was the first campus building not to be graded to one level. Tolman (1962) Edward Chace, psychology professor 1928 to 1954, during which time he was chairman of the psychology department. He led the faculty in opposing a campus loyalty oath in the early 1950s, for which he was fired, then later rehired. It is thus appropriate that the \u0026ldquo;Democracy Wall\u0026rdquo; is in this building, just outside the education library. His portrait is in the lobby of the Psych (west) side of building. If you go to room 5324 on Wednesdays between 1:00 and 4:00 grad students will give you $3 to participate in psychology experiments. Warren (1955) Earl, class of 1912, former California governor and Supreme Court justice, reluctant chairman of the Warren Commission, who contributed to University expansion while he was governor and got this ugly building named after him. Wellman (1912) Harry R., class of 1924 and 1926, professor of agricultural economics, acting University President in 1967 when the building\u0026rsquo;s name was changed from Agriculture Hall. This is a lovely old building that has been thoroughly trashed by its inhabitants and deserves better. The interior was remodeled in 1964, when the huge center rotunda was closed to the public. National Register, 1982. Wheeler (1917) Benjamin Ide, University President, 1899 to 1919 the Golden Age of Howard and Phoebe Hearst. Wheeler was born in Massachusetts and graduated from Brown and the University of Heidelberg. He taught philology and Greek at Cornell, and also taught at Brown and in Athens and Berlin. Under his leadership campus enrollment increased fourfold, and he started 20 new departments. He was a charismatic and beloved figure, and was known for his rapport with students; he was instrumental in setting up systems of student self-government. In his first speech to the student body, he used the phrase \u0026ldquo;it has been good to be here,\u0026rdquo; which is now an expression associated with him. He personally led a group of students to salvage paintings form the Mark Hopkins Art Institute during the 1906 fire in San Francisco. He was gently removed from control of the University in 1918, because of his German sympathies, and retired in 1919; he died in Vienna in 1927. Wheeler Hall was named for him while he was President. His bust is in the lobby. A three alarm fire set in 1969 by what appeared to be a professional arsonist destroyed the original Howard ceiling of Wheeler Auditorium; the new ceiling is made of wood, designed in Japanese style with the Maybeck dragon head motif. Check out the lamps in the lobby. Rumor has it that the Wheeler steps were supposed to slope all the way to Strawberry Creek, but the builders cut them off when they matched the existing grade, thus creating Wheeler Plaza. National Register, 1982.\n Wurster (1964) William W., class of 1919, Dean of the Architecture School, 1950 to 1959, Dean of the College of Environmental Design, 1959 to 1962, and Catherine Bauer Wurster, lecturer in city and regional planning, whose bust is in the environmental design library. The building was designed by Vernon de Mars (ASUC complex), Joseph Esherick (Anthony Hall) and Donald Olsen (it must have been his fault). The eight foot tall angel in the library, known as the \u0026ldquo;Arch Angel,\u0026rdquo; is a cast of the Smiling Angel on the north portal of Reim Cathedral, probably sculpted around 1240, left over from the French exhibit at the Panama Pacific Exposition. Zellerbach (1964) Isadore and Jennie B., who contributed $1 million to the building (we students contributed $2.5 million and the University borrowed the remaining $3.3 million). The naming of this \u0026ldquo;architectural atrocity\u0026rdquo; (so termed by a visiting professor in a letter to the Daily Cal) was the cause of a controversy in 1967. The University announced the name during summer break; when the students found out, many protested naming a building after someone whose corporation\u0026rsquo;s plant in Louisiana violated discrimination laws. The ASUC voted to boycott Crown-Zellerbach, and a student vote opposed the name. After Martin Luther King was shot, his name was suggested for the theater; the Student Union across the plaza was later named for him.  Dorms #  The Units and the older dorms are not part of the main campus, but those who live in them may be interested in the origins of their names:\n Bowles Philip E., class of \u0026lsquo;82, Regent. Still all-male. Manville Hiram Edward Jr., brother of the Countess Bernadat, who gave $500,000 to the law school. Stern Rosalie M., wife of Sigmund, former manager of the Blue and Gold. This dorm was originally to be for men, built like Bowles, and northeast of Memorial Stadium. Things changed. Still all-female. Cheney May L., creator and director of the UC Teacher Placement Office, 1898 to 1938. Originally all-female. Deutsch Monroe E., Latin professor, University Vice President. Originally all-male. Freeborn Mary C., fought for a women\u0026rsquo;s dorm association and helped establish the first women\u0026rsquo;s coop. Originally all-female. Putnam Thomas M., active in ASUC athletics. Originally all-male. Davidson Mary B., member of the Dean\u0026rsquo;s staff for 40 years, founder of WDA and the Dorm Housemothers\u0026rsquo; Association. Originally all-female. Participant in the Chess Game (see Ehrman). Griffiths Farmham P., faculty member and Regent. Originally all-male. Ehrman Sidney M., Regent and Hastings trustee. Originally all-male. This dorm challenged Davidson to the World\u0026rsquo;s Largest Chess Game in 1960. Each window on the court side of the buildings was a square, and each piece was several feet high. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who won. Cunningham Ruby L., senior physician for women at Student Health Services for 26 years. Originally all-female. Norton William J., Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s first business manager. Author of the policy adopted in 1945 that campus residence halls would be built to house at least 20% of the student population. Originally all-male. Priestly Herbert Ingram, class of 1917, Mexican history professor, director of the Institute for International Relations in 1930 and Bancroft Library in 1940. His son Kenneth was editor of the Daily Cal. Originally all-male. Spens-Black Sally, left $500,000 to the University though she was not an alumna. Originally all-female. Ida Sproul Mrs. Sproul worked for better student housing, especially for women, while her husband was Chancellor. Originally all-female.  Two distinguished local architects, Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan, are represented on this campus. Maybeck, a former architecture professor at the University, is known in the Bay Area for his Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and the Christian Science Church at Haste and Bowditch in Berkeley, as well as several fine houses in the Berkeley Hills. On campus, he designed the Men\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club, actually an aggregate founded on the original faculty club cottage, now the kitchen of the existing building. This building was constructed on the site of a Native American village near Strawberry Creek. Henry Morse Stephens had an apartment built over the north entry, where he lived until his death in 1918. It is said his ghost haunts these rooms\u0026ndash;this is the only campus ghost I\u0026rsquo;ve run across.\nMaybeck also designed Hearst Hall, built for Phoebe at the corner of Channing and Piedmont and moved to where Wurster Hall is now in 1900. This striking wooden edifice, used as a women\u0026rsquo;s gym as well as a meeting place, was lit inside by 900 incandescent lamps, which gave an unusual and attractive effect. It burned down in 1922. Its pools, undamaged by the fire, were used until the Hearst Gym was completed in 1927. From 1934 to 1955, when the site was cleared for Wurster Hall, they served as a hydraulic basin for engineering experiments.\nJulia Morgan graduated from Berkeley with a degree in civil engineering in 1894, the first woman to study in the College of Engineering. She later became the first woman to graduate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts architecture school in 1902. Her most famous work is Hearst Castle at San Simeon, but she built more than 800 structures, including the clock tower and other buildings at Mills College, the Asilomar Conference Center near Monterey, the Berkeley City Club, and the remodeling of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. She worked with Howard and Hearst on campus as well as on her own. She designed the Hearst Gym, with a wonderfully ornamented pool similar to one at San Simeon, and Girton Hall, a small, unpretentious, comfortable wood building in a redwood grove. She also designed the Tudor \u0026ldquo;Kellogg House\u0026rdquo; at 2232 Piedmont Row, now used for anthropology offices.\nMottoes and Memorials #  Many mottoes exhort us from lintels all over the campus; unfortunately, most of them are in languages most of us don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Our motto expert, with the assistance of the Classics Department, can help.\nClassical inscriptions #   \u0026ldquo;fiat lux\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Let there be light,\u0026rdquo; Genesis 1:3, the motto of the University of California, is written over Sather Gate and backwards on the canopy over the entrance to the Campanile, puzzling many students with the inscription \u0026ldquo;XVL TAIF\u0026rdquo; surrounding a pentagram. \u0026ldquo;bene legere saecla vincere\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;To read well is to conquer the ages.\u0026quot; Over the door to the catalog room of the Doe Library. \u0026ldquo;mirurn est ut animus agitatione motique corporis excitetur\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It is marvelous how the mind is awakened by the stirring and motion of the body\u0026rdquo; (i.e. exercise). On the facade of Harmon Gym. A classics professor explained to me that this line is actually a joke; it can be found in a letter from Pliny the Younger to Tacitus, in which he described a boar hunt in which he participated by writing speeches while his slaves did the work. It is a parody of a line of Tacitus\u0026rsquo;, who remarked on the salubrious effects of the \u0026ldquo;stirring and motion\u0026rdquo; of civil ferment. \u0026ldquo;hunc pontem dono dedit classis studentum quae in anno MDCCCCX foras exiit ne memoria sua apud posteros pereat Phoebe Apperson Hearst impensis subvenit\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The class (fleet) which in 1910 departed these portals has placed this bridge lest memory of it be lost. Phoebe Apperson Hearst donated money to this project.\u0026rdquo; Apparently the original inscription began \u0026ldquo;hanc pontem\u0026rdquo; until some students finally convinced the professor responsible for the translation that he was wrong. If you look carefully, you can see where the correction was made.  The Greek inscription on the right side of the football statue south of LSB reads, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who competes wins all,\u0026rdquo; a moving tribute to capitalism. The somewhat garbled Greek inscription in the lobby of Wheeler Hall, loosely translated, reads, \u0026ldquo;There are thousands of virtues of men, but one stands out from them all\u0026ndash;the ability to govern justly.\u0026rdquo; This does not appear to be a classical quotation.\nEnglish inscriptions #   \u0026ldquo;To rescue for human society the native values of rural life\u0026rdquo; This phrase looks out from the side of Hilgard Hall onto a campus increasingly built over and denuded of greenery and open space. Howard had originally planned the inspiring \u0026ldquo;Given by the people to the State of California, A.D. 1915,\u0026rdquo; but Wheeler preferred \u0026ldquo;To bring food for the peoples from the breast of the earth.\u0026rdquo; Whether the problem was too socialist a sentiment, or the word \u0026ldquo;breast,\u0026rdquo; Wheeler changed his mind at the last minute to the existing motto, substituting \u0026ldquo;native\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;moral.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We ring, we chime, we toll; lend ye the silent part\u0026ndash;some answer in the heart, some echo in the soul.\u0026rdquo; Guess where this one is? Etched on one of the tower bells\u0026ndash;a line from a poem by Isaac Flagg.  The flat planes of Boalt Hall were apparently just crying out to be written on. Consider this:\n You will study the wisdom of the past, for in a wilderness of conflicting counsels, a trail has there been blazed. You will study the life of mankind, for this is the life you must order, and, to order with wisdom, must know. You will study the precepts of justice, for these are the truths that through you shall come to their hour of triumph. Here is the high emprise, the fine endeavour, the splendid possibility of achievement, to which I summon you and bid you welcome. (Cardozo)\n Or this:\n When I think thus of the law, I see a princess mightier than she who once wrought at Bayeaux, eternally weaving into her web dim figures of the ever-lengthening past\u0026ndash;figures too dim to be noticed by the idle, too symbolic to be interpreted except by her pupils, but to the discerning eye disclosing every painful step and every worldshaking contest by which mankind has worked and fought its way from savage isolation to organic social life. (Holmes)\n The law school asked many prominent people for suggestions for quotations; the University could have saved itself some money if it had chosen one of the other submissions: \u0026ldquo;There is only one Boalt but many nuts.\u0026rdquo;\nMemorials #  Fifteen great names circle the top of Doe\u0026rsquo;s card catalog room: Cervantes, Cuvier, Dante, Darwin, Descartes, Erasmus, Galileo, Gibbon, Goethe, Gutenberg, Kant, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Adam Smith and Voltaire. An interesting assortment\u0026mdash;four poets, a novelist, three scientists, three philosophers, three social scientists, and a publisher. Four Englishmen, three Frenchmen, three Germans, three Italians, a Spaniard and a Dutchman. Fifteen men, no women. We can thank English and literature professor Charles Mills Gayley and history professor Henry Morse Stephens for this list-they claimed to have chosen people who \u0026ldquo;had been unique contributors to progress through the medium of books\u0026rdquo;; each had created \u0026ldquo;a typical chapter of thought or has transformed for better the conditions of civilization.\u0026rdquo; Rumor has it that Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who had received his Ph.D. at Heidelberg and had taught at the University of Berlin, altered the list to show his support for Germany. Rumor also has it that during World War I students defaced the three German names. Why Cuvier, for God\u0026rsquo;s sake, and not Newton or Copernicus?\nThe ceiling we see today in the card catalog room was the original Howard creation from 1911. In 1960 it was covered by a \u0026ldquo;suspended luminous grid\u0026rdquo; by order of the administration; later buildings blocked light coming in from the windows, and the original twelve chandeliers were too dim to work by. William Wurster, who was in charge of the project, carefully pulled them up and installed the grid without disrupting the ceiling, figuring the administration would someday change its mind. The grid came down in 1974, when the ceiling was rediscovered by workers installing a sprinkler system; mercury vapor lamps were put in the chandeliers to make them bright enough.\nFour pillars in the lobby of Doe Library boast busts of Homer, Marcus Aurelius, Augustus, and Hermes. Pick the one that is not a classical literary figure.\nThe concrete fountain just north of the Campanile was given by the University Cadets in 1905, in honor of John Mitchell, known as \u0026ldquo;Old Mitch,\u0026rdquo; the University Armorer from 1895 to 1904, a colorful man with a huge walrus moustache who thrilled students with tales of Indian battles. The armory was in the basement of Old Harmon Gym, ironically in approximately the same place as the bomb shelter in 52 Dwinelle.\nOne of the weirdest campus memorials can be found on the northwest side of Edwards Track. It marks the site of William Keith\u0026rsquo;s house, 50 yards east of the location of the plaque. He was apparently a local artist from the 1880s to his death in 1911; the plaque was placed by the Keith Art Association of Berkeley in 1954. The only piece of work by him that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen is an enormous canvas at the Oakland Museum called \u0026ldquo;King\u0026rsquo;s River Canyon.\u0026rdquo;\nMy other favorite is the popular Ludwig\u0026rsquo;s Fountain, built in 1961. It was named after Ludwig von Schwarenberg, a German shorthair pointer who lived in the fountain from its construction until he and his family moved to Alameda in 1965, except for the time he was tied up at home in 1962 for running through Tolman Hall (then under construction) with a tube of green paint in his mouth, peeing on the walls. The fountain was shut down, but restarted by popular request in 1978.\nBenches #  The most popular type of memorial here is the bench\u0026mdash;the campus is littered with them. The oldest may be the generic redwood trunk benches donated to the UC Forestry Club by the Union Lumber Company in 1921, which were originally placed in a circle in Forester\u0026rsquo;s Circle in the Eucalyptus Grove but which you\u0026rsquo;ll now find in Faculty Glade, facing Wellman Hall and University House, in the Mining Circle, south of Mulford Hall, and just east of Sather Gate. Several wood benches have recently been placed on campus as memorials. A bench in a small grove near Wurster Hall is dedicated to Roslyn Lindheim, 1921-1987; faculty member and author of The Hospitalization of Space; \u0026ldquo;her work bridged intuition, feelings, people and academic learning for healthier and more humane environments.\u0026rdquo; The curved bench facing Wellman is dedicated to Thomas Forsyth Hunt, Dean of the School of Agriculture, 1912 to 1923. A wooden bench in front of Moses Hall is dedicated to H. Paul Grice, philosopher, who died in 1988. A similar (but more elegant) bench just north of Sproul Hall is dedicated to John 1. Danielson, director of financial aid from 1968 to 1982. My favorite bench, the redwood log near Sather Gate, has recently been dedicated by the class of 1965 to Raymond James Sontag, Ehrman Professor of History. The trees surrounding it have been trimmed so that you can no longer sit there and observe or eavesdrop on passersby undetected. A set of benches in a small courtyard just north of Harmon Gym is dedicated to Clinton R. \u0026ldquo;Brick\u0026rdquo; Morse, author of \u0026ldquo;Sons of California\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Hail California.\u0026rdquo;\nThe peripatetic Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Bench, that monument to bygone sexism and classism, has had many incarnations over nearly a century. The first one was erected in 1898 around the flagpole that stood on the site of the Campanile. Stanford students stole the fence around it the following year, to the derisive thanks of Cal senior men. The second bench was erected near North Hall, where it remained until 1917. The third one, a wooden boatlike object north of Wheeler Hall, was inscribed \u0026ldquo;This bench, a symbol of Senior Control, is dedicated by the class of 1921 to the 1920 championship varsity football team\u0026rdquo; and was dedicated by then ex-president Wheeler. It was apparently soon moved to a site between Wheeler Hall and Sather Gate, where it resided until it was kidnapped to the Mining Circle by engineering students in 1935. In 1938 it was spotted near Eshleman (now Stephens) Hall and Moses Hall. In 1950 it burned (all of the Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Benches were wood). A new one was dedicated in 1952; soon after, however, students lost interest in such things. I believe that the Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Bench exists today in an obscure location\u0026mdash;a small redwood grove facing the east courtyard of Wurster Hall. This huge area is currently totally wasted\u0026mdash;I wonder what it would take for it to function as a pleasant, welcoming open space?\nBelieve it or not, many classes have grown so attached to the University, and so rich as a result of their Berkeley educations, that they have donated money for gifts to the campus. Formerly each graduating class planted a tree at commencement; the first was a cypress, in 1874, which was cut down in the 1930s to make room for a building. Classes still give memorial chairs in the Greek Theater.\nThe class of 1877 donated the sundial, which in 1915 was placed south of the Campanile, where the subsequent planting of a pine grove rendered it almost completely nonfunctional. The class of \u0026lsquo;96 contributed the plaque on Founder\u0026rsquo;s Rock. The class of \u0026lsquo;97 celebrated its silver jubilee (25 years) by building the semicircular bench that faces Bancroft Library. The class of \u0026lsquo;98 placed the plaque on the LeConte Oak.\nClass gifts #  The bench facing Wellman Hall is inscribed, \u0026ldquo;To hold in remembrance that Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California, gave self government to undergraduate students, the class of 1905 has set this bench, 1910.\u0026rdquo; The class of 1910 gave the concrete arch bridge between Faculty Glade and the science buildings. The class of 1914 donated the fountain and the concrete bench around it that currently serve as the \u0026ldquo;southeast gate\u0026rdquo; to campus. It was the recipient of an elaborate dedication in 1968, in which water was poured into it from the Bay, Strawberry Creek, and the Chemistry Pond, which is now covered by Haviland Hall\u0026ndash;apparently a dunk in its disgusting dirty water was considered appropriate punishment for unacceptable behavior. A pint of beer was thrown in for good measure. I understand the fountain has been inoperative since 1976.\nOne of the most interesting class gifts is near the entrance to the Campanile; two melancholy bears top a bench donated by the class of 1920 to recognize the Sons of the University killed in the Great War. The NROTC class of \u0026lsquo;42 has provided a somewhat less elegant bench just north of Harmon Gym, dedicated to those lost in World War 11.\nStephens Hall, which was the Student Union in the 1920s, was the recipient of several gifts. The class of 1921 built it a fireplace, and the class of 1922 gave money to furnish the hall. The concrete and brick bridge connecting Stephens with Faculty Glade is a gift of the class of 1923, \u0026ldquo;in memory of happy days on the campus and in appreciation of benefits received from their alma mater. \u0026quot; About 10 feet away from this bridge is a colorful mosaic fountain commemorating the Young Ladies\u0026rsquo; Club, the first women\u0026rsquo;s organization on campus, which was founded in 1874, the year the first women graduated. Berkeley, incidentally, was a bit before its time in the area of women\u0026rsquo;s education; by the turn of the century fully half of the student body was women. Jessica Peixotto, one of these students, became the first woman to teach here when she was appointed Professor of Social Economy in the 1920s.\nThe class of 1925 gave us the courtyard and steps between Moses and Stephens Halls, completed in 1984\u0026mdash;that area was far more important to campus life than it is now. The class of 1926 commissioned The Abundant Life in memory of Benjamin Ide Wheeler. The class of 1927 gave the flagpole in front of LSB, the class of 1928 gave a bust of Wheeler (who Howard Fast called the most beautiful human being he\u0026rsquo;d ever seen) for the lobby of Wheeler Hall, and the class of 1929 donated the Golden Bear in front of Zellerbach Auditorium, the one that Vernon de Mars wanted Stanford to paint red.\nIn 1979 the class of 1928 gave us an audible rather than visible gift\u0026mdash;36 new bells for the carillon. In 1934 Japanese alumni donated money and two stone lanterns for a Japanese garden, which was planted on the north side of Strawberry Creek between LSB and Wellman Hall. They have been relocated to just south of Alumni House. The class of 1935 built a small wooden amphitheater on the south bank of Strawberry Creek, just east of Sather Gate. The class of 1940 gave the water fountain and small courtyard on the northeast side of Wheeler, which gives the best tasting water on campus. The class of 1941 gave floodlights for the Campanile, the class of 1946 installed the patterned paving in Sproul Plaza, the class of 1953 gave the maps placed around campus (there is a plaque on the one in front of the Campanile), and recently the class of 1954 gave the new north gate. The grass plot in the middle of the court just west of the Campanile, where the sundial should have gone, is crying out for a class gift, as is the courtyard just south of the arch of Tolman Hall. A more ambitious class, or perhaps one that wants to begin a continuing project, could begin the West Approach; I occasionally stand on the steps near the west face of the Campanile, looking toward the Golden Gate, and remember that this vista used to be valued, and think that the class that restores it by straightening, leveling and paving the road from the Campanile to the west end of campus would earn our undying gratitude.\nCampus Art #  Given the age of the University, and its development over the years, our outdoor art is, not surprisingly, a mixed bag. The unanimous favorite, I venture to say, is \u0026ldquo;The Last Dryad\u0026rdquo; in Faculty Glade. This bronze nude was done in the 1920s by Alexander Sterling Calder, father of the Alexander Calder and Sculptor in Chief of the Panama Pacific Exposition. It was not exhibited during his lifetime because the model\u0026rsquo;s husband threatened to sue because he could recognize her face (let\u0026rsquo;s hope he could recognize more than that). After Calder\u0026rsquo;s death in 1945, his daughter, Margaret Calder Hayes, class of 1917, presented it to the University. After several years of seclusion in the Hearst Women\u0026rsquo;s Gym, it was finally placed outside in the 1960s, where it is certainly happier. If you like this piece, check out the Star Girl, the Panama Pacific Exposition\u0026rsquo;s theme piece, in the Oakland Museum (or its replica in the courtyard of the Citicorp building at the corner of Sutter and Sansome Streets in San Francisco).\nAlthough I have heard people swear it\u0026rsquo;s Peder Sather, the bust on the south side of the Campanile is in fact Abraham Lincoln, and was sculpted by John Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), who got good at doing Presidents after carving Mount Rushmore. The University acquired this piece after San Francisco\u0026rsquo;s Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915, held in commemoration of the opening of the Panama Canal, which littered the University as well as the city with various artifacts including Maybeck\u0026rsquo;s Palace of Fine Arts. It was kept in the basement of Doe Library until Lincoln\u0026rsquo;s birthday, 1921, when a suitable pedestal and position were prepared for it. The Oakland Museum owns a painting by Borglum, called \u0026ldquo;Scouts on the Alert.\u0026rdquo;\nMy favorite piece of campus art is the lively colorful WPA mosaic on the east side of what is now \u0026ldquo;Mostly Stationery,\u0026rdquo; just north of Sproul. This building, designed by Howard, started its life as a powerhouse in 1904, was moved in 1913, became the Spreckels Art Gallery in 1933 and got decorated in 1936-1937. It was moved to its present site from the site of Morrison Hall in 1955, and remained an art gallery until the opening of the UAM in 1971. The two panels are \u0026ldquo;Sculpture\u0026rdquo; by Helen Bruton (who also did in Hertz Hall) and \u0026ldquo;Dancing\u0026rdquo; by Florence A. Swift.\nSome of the modem efforts just don\u0026rsquo;t cut it The precast concrete relief on the north side of Morgan Hall is one of the worst\u0026ndash;six people in profile representing, presumably, the useful arts. I have to admit, though, that I like the \u0026ldquo;frames\u0026rdquo; along one side of the Morgan Hall courtyard that frame the view of Tolman Hall (harmonious) and Hilgard Hall (disharmonious)\u0026ndash;the experience of looking at them both in the frames is thought provoking.\nIn the 1960s Austen K. SaIz, an art professor, and his wife Helen left us two modem sculptures, \u0026ldquo;Voyage\u0026rdquo; by Richard O\u0026rsquo;Hanlon, near Hertz and Morrison Halls, and \u0026ldquo;Interior Force,\u0026rdquo; between Wheeler Hall and Strawberry Creek, sculpted by Ralph Stackpole (1885-1973), who did the sculpture in front of the New York Stock Exchange. The Oakland Museum owns a bronze of his, should you like to see more of his work.\nThe football statue near the west entrance was sculpted in 1893 by Douglas Tilden (1960-1935), a graduate of the California School for the Deaf. You can see more of his work in the City, in Golden Gate Park and on Market (he did the wonderful Mechanics Statue in Battery Park) and at the Oakland Museum, which has a small bronze called \u0026ldquo;The Golden Gate.\u0026rdquo; Senator James D. Phelan promised the football statue to the university that won two Big Games in a row. This was Berkeley, in 1898 and 1899; the statue was erected in 1900, unintentionally providing a landmark for the gay community.\nMuch of our sculpture is animals, like the sleeping lions in front of University House, the Ming dogs, donated by Alfred Bender in 1933, which used to be in front of the art gallery but were moved to the entrance of Durant Hall in 1978, the \u0026ldquo;dirty bird\u0026rdquo; in front of Anthony Hall, sculpted by Frances Rich of Santa Barbara, and the Smilodon in the plaza south of ESB, commissioned by the University from \u0026ldquo;Trader Vic\u0026rdquo; Bergeron and completed in 1975.\nBut of course the most predominant image is the bear. There\u0026rsquo;s the gold one on a pedestal in front of Zellerbach Auditorium, the small \u0026ldquo;Puchinelli Bear\u0026rdquo; in the bushes between the ASUC complex and Strawberry Creek, erected by O.J. Woodward II, class of 1930, the melancholy bears mourning dead soldiers on the bench in front of the Campanile, and the new reclining bears on the grass between O\u0026rsquo;Brien and Davis Halls, sculpted by Edmund Schulte Beckum in 1915 and given in 1986 by A. John Macchi, class of 1936. And of course there\u0026rsquo;s the poor stuffed grizzly in the ASUC; its kidnapping by Stanford some years ago was the subject of several Farley strips in the Chronicle.\nOn my last last visit to campus I spotted a large metal pyramid with a dangerous-looking projection like a scorpion\u0026rsquo;s tail, just southwest of the new North Gate and west of McCone Hall. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a plaque to identify this object\u0026rsquo;s name, date or creator.\nPlants and Trees #  Berkeley had two notable trees in its history, both of which no longer exist but have designated replacements. LeConte Oak was a huge tree dedicated with a plaque in 1898. It was blown over in a storm in 1939, but replaced with a new one on the same spot. You will find it just west of LSB Annex along the path through the Eucalyptus Grove.\nWheeler Oak, a gathering place for University women after Wheeler Hall was built, was removed in 1934 on the advice of experts who said it was old and had been sick since 1910 from living in concrete. A plaque marked its former location until the plaza in front of Wheeler was built in 1952. Alumni found and resited the plaque two years later, and a new oak was planted.\nThe Eucalyptus Grove at the confluence of the north and south branches of Strawberry Creek was planted in 1877, to protect the new cinder running track from the west wind. It is the tallest hardwood grove in America; some of these trees are more than 200 feet tall.\nThe stand of Canary Island pines just south of the Campanile was planted in 1917, two years after the sundial was placed. The huge white ghost of a tree on the north side of Faculty Glade is a California Buckeye, planted in 1882. It is in fact still alive and flowers in May. Other California Buckeyes, not as old and venerable, can be found near the north side of the War Memorial Bridge.\nAn oak on the hill in Faculty Glade is dedicated to Henry Morse Stephens. The gnarled trees along the Esplanade, what remains of the Golden Gate axis, and the south side of Mulford are London planes, a hybrid sycamore. They were salvaged from the Panama Pacific Exposition, and are meant to represent the trees in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Lyceum.\nPerhaps the most important tree on campus is the Dawn Redwood, the earliest species of redwood, located behind the small gate to the right of the Men\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club (there are also supposed to be three in front of ESB). Biology professor Ralph Cheney preserved this species by bringing seeds back from China in 1941. Thanks to him there are now about 25,000 in the US.\nHoward\u0026rsquo;s 1908 campus plan called for a 50 foot wide garden area between the Hearst Mining pool and another pool located where Moffitt Library is now as a botanical garden. I personally advocate dynamiting Evans Hall and Moffitt Library (the destruction of the rest of the required area is already underway) to follow this plan. Short of that, how about at least restoring the old practice farm in Wellman Courtyard? The campus has a botanical garden in Strawberry Canyon and the research and teaching functions of botanical gardens are fulfilled elsewhere\u0026ndash;but something like this should remain on campus for nonstudents to enjoy and learn from.\nStrawberry Creek and its Bridges #  Before the University was here, this area was part of Strawberry Creek\u0026rsquo;s watershed; the smaller streams have since been culverted, covered and rerouted and all that remain flowing at the surface are the north and south branches. The central branch was filled in 1877 to build a running track where LSB is now.\nThe north branch is released from its culvert somewhere inside the Chancellor\u0026rsquo;s Garden, an inexcusable fenced off waste of area on a campus increasingly pressed for open space. One wooden bridge provides access from the road to the garden. Two more wooden footbridges cross the creek just south of University House and east of Gianini\u0026ndash; the northern one has a lovely winding stone staircase on the northwest side. The creek meanders southwest; it is clear, in a sandy bed, running over small falls into still, clear, sunny pools. One bank is high and covered with ivy; the other has large stones to sit on as well as vegetation including a stand of redwoods. Several trees have fallen across the creek; in addition to the concrete pipe conduits these make good crossovers or places to sit with your feet over the creek. This stretch of the creek is the most pleasant and attractive on campus. Along here you will run across the north fork\u0026rsquo;s height gauge\u0026ndash;it will give you some idea about how high the creek can get.\nThe next two bridges are wooden\u0026ndash;one for cars and people, between Moffitt Library and Wellman Hall, and the next just for people, with a peculiar L-shape on the east side. The car bridge is great to hide under, for that elusive privacy increasingly difficult to find on a crowded campus.\nThe creek after these bridges narrows, with masonry banks. A sunny, well frequented meadow at a bend in the creek near a small footbridge precedes the intensively and diversely landscaped area which runs parallel to the north side of LSB. I believe this area was the original botanical garden, and that the two Japanese lanterns now near Alumni House used to be here. It is hard to get near the creek here because of the dense ivy that surrounds it. It would be a great area to enjoy, especially where a tree over the creek makes a convenient seat, if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the nearby construction noise. Just northwest of LSB the creek disappears underground through an ugly grate and culvert. It goes under University Circle, coming out just southwest of it into a deep pool filled with junk and surrounded by stone walls. I have seen fish more than a foot long here. The creek then follows a series of noisy cataracts to its confluence with the south fork at the comer of the Eucalyptus Grove, where sitting logs and stepping stumps have been installed across from a small sunny meadow.\nThe south fork appears on campus from a concrete culvert across the street west of Girton Hall. A path on the north bank makes this fork easy to follow. It travels over a narrow rocky bed between dirt banks where redwoods, ivy and ferns grow. It forms the border of the Women\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club\u0026rsquo;s garden, where a finial has somehow taken a nose dive into the creek. An S-curve borders the Men\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club, where four stumps and a brick foundation mark the site of bizarre tenuregranting rituals. The last sighting of salmon in Strawberry Creek was here, in 1930. The first two bridges over this fork, wooden and concrete, are near the Senior Men\u0026rsquo;s Hall and Men\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club. The underground middle fork joins the south fork through a culvert just north of here.\nThe creek then forms the northern boundary of Faculty Glade; not a particularly pleasant area. The class of 1910 bridge crosses here, but concrete pipe culverts on either side offer alternative ways of crossing. These alternatives were frequently used several years ago when a \u0026ldquo;troll\u0026rdquo; demanding payment took up residence under this bridge, as part of student art project. You might actually find some strawberries here, amid the ivy, and from the next bridge, a concrete arch with metal railings, you can see blackberries. This bridge, designed by ubiquitous campus landscaper Thomas D. Church, and built in 1966, was barricaded by the Save Faculty Glade Vigilantes, a group of landscape architecture students and faculty disturbed by the increasing traffic it would encourage through the glade. But it is impossible to stop progress, i.e. destruction of the campus environment, as they soon learned.\nThe creek then detours neatly around Stephens Hall, and under the lovely brick and iron class of 1923 bridge. The creek here is at its most attractive; the vegetation is lush and diverse, and its rocky bed gives it a great sound. A small wooden footbridge precedes a redwood grove, dedicated to Brutus K. Hamilton, 1900-1970, where the creek widens. Here the south bank is an elaborate log structure. After a concrete pipe shortcut comes the paved bridge from Moses to Barrows Halls. The creek proceeds behind Moses Hall, which unconscionably ignores it. Two wooden footbridges flank the back of Anthony Hall, where a terrace with umbrellaed tables face the creek\u0026ndash;a great lunch or study spot.\nThe best constructed river area gives way to the worst\u0026ndash;a fenced-off utility area inexcusable in this location. It should be moved to a less attractive and central spot, freeing this land for more congenial use. Farther downstream, north of Sproul Hall, eroded banks as well as two picnic tables, the water gauge, and the class of 1935 amphitheater attest to the area\u0026rsquo;s use. Just downstream is the widest and busiest bridge, connecting Sproul Plaza to Dwinelle Plaza.\nThe creek retains its public character as it continues through redwoods just north of the ASUC complex. This area is not that attractive, with a high concrete wall forming the south bank. Many paths and makeshift stepping stones show the ingenuity of students late for class in Dwinelle Hall, too hurried to use the wooden arch bridge with iron rails that crosses just west of ASUC. The next bridge downstream is my personal favorite\u0026ndash;a high masonry arch, built in 1967, which presides over the creek at its most Tennysonian, with masonry terraces, verdant meadows, both sunny and shady, babbling brook\u0026ndash;it is an excellent picnic spot when not too crowded. The creek widens downstream when it is released from its masonry confines\u0026ndash;the banks are high and planted with redwoods.\nThe most interesting bridge is in this area\u0026ndash;the bay tree bridge, with a hole in the middle, surrounded by a bench, through which a large tree grows. Try climbing down the tree and under the bridge. The next bridge is a concrete car bridge, and then the creek returns to the redwoods. Just west of the football statue, an ivy covered masonry wall precedes the concrete war memorial bridge, with its Star of David railings, into the Eucalyptus Grove. A wooden footbridge provides a crossing into the grove, but the banks are so low and the creek so narrow it\u0026rsquo;s hardly worth it.\nFrom the confluence, the creek heads southwest toward Edwards Stadium. This area is heavily wooded; a hollowed out stump facing the creek on the east bank makes an excellent bench. You have now entered squirrel country\u0026ndash;though they don\u0026rsquo;t seem so numerous or obnoxious as they used to be. The last bridge over the creek is a long wooden skew bridge from BART and Berkeley into the central campus. The creek leaves the surface through the remains of a filter, and a masonry culvert under Oxford Street just north of the stadium, amid a small redwood grove. Nearby is the plaque which marks the site where Don Pedro Fage\u0026rsquo;s scientific expedition sighted the Golden Gate on March 27, 1772.\nThe Campanile and Other Clocks #  The most striking symbol of the University is of course Sather Tower, known as the Campanile, modeled after (and in my opinion superior to) St. Mark\u0026rsquo;s Campanile in Venice (this is the origin of the epithet \u0026ldquo;Marksist\u0026rdquo; as applied to Berkeley). It was completed in December 1914, stands 307 feet (30 stories) tall (as compared to Stanford\u0026rsquo;s Hoover Tower, only 285 feet tall), is made of reinforced concrete and steel I-beams, and is going to be the last structure in Berkeley to remain standing when the Big One hits. The site of the Campanile has always been the center of the campus\u0026ndash;it was originally the courtyard between Bacon Hall and the two original buildings, and was marked by a flagpole until the Campanile was built.\nThe first twelve bells were brought through U-boat patrolled waters from England in late 1917; the 13th bell was the one from Bacon Hall and was added in 1925. In 1979 36 new bells were added and another 13 in 1983, making a complete five chromatic octaves. The bells are played from 12:00 to 12:15 Monday through Saturday and at 2:00 on Sundays. Our fine carillon attracts noted campanologists from all over the world, who occasionally play special concerts. The bells announce extraordinary events (they rang at 2:30 a.m. on November 11, 1918, when the Armistice was signed) as well as scheduled ones (every term they are silent during Dead Week, after a rendition of \u0026ldquo;Tom Dooley\u0026rdquo;).\nOne of the humor magazines once ran a cartoon about what\u0026rsquo;s really in the Campanile; what\u0026rsquo;s really in the Campanile is the geography department\u0026rsquo;s seismographic records since 1910, and five floors of paleontology\u0026rsquo;s fossils from the La Brea Tarpits, Shasta Valley and the Great Karoo, among other places. The Campanile has always been used for storage because the temperature inside fluctuates so little. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to resist such an obvious target for a prank. The Hiking Club planted a pink and yellow bunny on the spike on the top in 1955, and followed that the next year with a white flag with a blue C. Later that year climbers were caught before another outrage was perpetrated. In my day, a group associated with a fraternity attached a Mickey Mouse body and hands to one clock face. Bob Phillips, who studied at Berkeley in the \u0026rsquo;60s, wrote recently to tell me that this had not been the first time Mickey had been attached to a clock face of the Campanile; he tells his own story about that first time on this web page.\nTwo people have jumped to their deaths from the observation deck of the Campanile. The first, in 1959, was a retired attorney whose two sons had attended Berkeley. The second was two years later\u0026ndash;a sophomore engineering student. The tower was closed after that incident, only opening for one day, Charter Day\u0026ndash;the elevator operator, Curtis Elliot, died of a heart attack in the elevator that morning. In 1978 glass was put up in the tower windows but it was taken down a year later because it muffled the sound of the bells. Bars were put up in 1981; despite them a freshman stood outside for five hours in 1982 but was persuaded not to jump. Oddly enough, all three of these people chose the east side, even in the afternoon when that side of the tower was in shade.\nThe flower clock just south of the Chancellor\u0026rsquo;s House is a replica of one overlooking Lake Geneva. A delegation representing Swiss universities presented it to Berkeley in 1964. It was vandalized during a protest shortly afterward\u0026mdash;a photograph shows its hands pointing straight up. I am told by those who know that it is an excellent place for marijuana, which was growing there in 1967.\nMy favorite clock is the one that faces California Hall, looking over what was once the Sophomore Lawn. It was erected in 1929, and dedicated to Albert Miller, Regent from 1887 to 1900. It is supposed to be a bench, but whoever landscaped the area doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be aware of that. In 1968 someone stole the clock mechanism, leaving the graffito \u0026ldquo;time is getting short.\u0026rdquo;\nCampus Gates #  The University has a poor record of dealing with the community that surrounds it. It must be admitted in the University\u0026rsquo;s defense that it was here first, back when the community was known as Ocean View\u0026ndash;the city of Berkeley was not incorporated until 1878. It had only 437 people in 1870, growing to 13,000 by 1900. After 1903, when the opening of the Key Route shortened the commute time to San Francisco dramatically, and 1906, when many fled San Francisco after losing their homes, the city of Berkeley grew rapidly: 40,000 people in 1910, 50,000 in 1912, and a peak of 117,000 in 1970. By comparison, the University had 2,788 students and 153 faculty members in 1900, and 3,000 students in 1910, growing to 50,000 students in the late 1980s, with thousands of faculty and staff.\nThe original campus borders were the north and south forks of Strawberry Creek. The land in what is now the northwest campus was devoted to agriculture and military maneuvers, and by the 1910s contained the agricultural complex. The area opposite the south fork was encroached on more gradually, initially by Hearst Hall and other athletic facilities in the 1900s, Hearst Gym in the 1920s, Dwinelle Hall in the 1950s and finally the ASUC complex in the 1960s. This area, in contrast to the northwest comer, was a thriving community, with hotels, a French restaurant, grocery, laundry, meat market, and coffee shop that stayed open until 10:00.\nThe central campus rounded out its current shape with the addition of small parcels of land to the south and southeast. The little shingled building on Bancroft just west of Eshleman Hall is the old First Unitarian Church, designed by A.C. Schweinfurth, who had designed Phoebe Hearst\u0026rsquo;s house in Pleasanton. When it was built in 1898, the site did not belong to the University. Many faculty and students worshipped there. In 1957 the University purchased the land and planned to demolish the building, but never got around to it. The congregation moved to Kensington soon after, and the building has been a scene shop for the drama department since 1972. This is unfortunate because it is a charming and well-designed building which deserves better.\nThe two chartreuse ramshackle wooden houses just east of Wurster Hall, which now contain various University offices, were built by Warren Cheney in 1880. He was a writer for Sunset magazine and editor of the Californian. The houses along Piedmont Row have a varied history\u0026ndash;2234 and 2240 were moved to their current locations from the sites of International House and Boalt Hall. 2220 and 2240 were originally fraternity houses; the others were private homes. The walkway along the south side of 2234 is inlaid with a random selection of cheerful tiles.\nIn the early days, Olmstead recognized the importance of integrating the University into the community. His design for the area around campus, which included University Avenue as an extension of the campus axis, was ignored by developers (incidentally, the College Homestead Association, which developed the 125 acres west and south of campus, named its first 13 streets in alphabetical order from Allston south and from College west. If you know that College Avenue was originally Audubon, Telegraph Avenue was Choate, and Shattuck Avenue was Guyot, you can sort of see the pattern). Since then, however, the Regents have made no effort to incorporate the community into, or even inform the community of, its expansion and construction plans as it takes over more and more land and buildings outside its original borders. People\u0026rsquo;s Park is the most wellknown focus of the resulting tension, but I think that the incidents surrounding the acquisition of Clark Kerr Campus (formerly the School for the Deaf) show the University at its worst. The University naturally falls into an adversarial relationship with the city over this issue; as the University does not pay property taxes to the city, every time it expands the city loses money.\nAlthough the campus is not walled, only three true gates and one non-gate exist. The nongate, to save you unnecessary suspense, is at the comer of College Avenue and Bancroft Way, across from Cafe Strada (the Roma by any other name is still the best place to watch people). This is a large plaza flanked by Kroeber Hall and Boalt Law School to the left and right and the improbable vision of Wurster Hall dead ahead. The plaza contains a fountain and a bench but comes off as flat, featureless and unmemorable, if not fortresslike (Allen Temko suggested that these three buildings are fit for little except gun emplacements)\u0026ndash;it definitely needs some sort of frame. The area deserves a lot better, as it is the closest campus entrance to Hertz Auditorium.\nThe oldest campus gate is of course Sather Gate, erected in 1910. Jane K. Sather donated $36,000 for its construction, and liked it so much that she dedicated it to her husband. Howard intended its portals to represent the phases of university life. Its patinaed arch, bearing the University crest and the letters MDCCCCXVIIII (that\u0026rsquo;s 1919 in real money) on a side pillar, some of which occasionally go missing, was added later, as were the urns, sculpted by Earl Cummings, architecture professor and sculptor of the head of Minerva over the entrance of Doe Library. The gate originally sported eight panels depicting fields of learning as expressed by nude men and women\u0026ndash;men for hard sciences and women for humanities, of course. They were taken down the following year after Jane Sather, disgusted by the reactions of undergrads, wrote several letters to the Regents. They were replaced in 1979 as a result of a petition started by biochemistry graduate students. This gate was the actual campus entrance until the building of the ASUC complex completely surrounded it by campus. Before the extension the gate served an important purpose; as no political speech was allowed on campus it served as a gathering place for students and speakers with political agendas. I\u0026rsquo;m told the circle in the pavement south of the gate was the turntable for a horsedrawn trolley that ran between Oakland and Berkeley between 1873 and the early years of this century.\nSkinner Gate, built in 1964 at the comer of Oxford and Center Streets, is the campus\u0026rsquo; west entrance; a terrace overlooking a plaza which contains a large design set in concrete. Russell Severance Springer, class of 1902, left money specifically to build this gate, having admired Sather Gate. The compass rose does not indicate which direction is north, but it is safe to guess that the north arrow points toward Koshland Hall.\nI have little to say about the class of \u0026lsquo;54\u0026rsquo;s gift of a north gate, as it is after my time\u0026mdash;I can only refer the interested reader to the story of the design competition, and the class\u0026rsquo; total rejection of the winner in favor of something less phallic. I personally like it but find it rather awkwardly placed in the middle of nowhere; perhaps some additional walls or landscaping would make it more gatelike.\nYou will find the words \u0026ldquo;east gate\u0026rdquo; on maps; this gate consists of a road, a sign that says EAST GATE in blue letters on a yellow background, and a kiosk. Surely we can do better than this. At least the sign near Springer Gate says \u0026ldquo;Welcome to the Berkeley Campus.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are several informal merging points of city and campus. The northwest entrance through Tolman Hall, for example, is actually rather effective\u0026ndash;you walk in shade under an arcade and out into bright sunlight on the campus side; it feels very welcoming. The effect of the gate would be enhanced if cars did not park in the arcade, and if there were something to draw one through\u0026ndash; perhaps a monument or fountain in the grassy oval just south of the building. My favorite entrance is the flagstone path between Davis Hall and Naval Architecture, where you literally have to suck in your gut to get through; it was the quickest way to get from Northside, where I lived, to McLaughlin Hall, where I studied.\nState law used to require that all campus thoroughfares be closed 24 hours each year to keep the property from reverting to public use. Berkeley used to hold its \u0026ldquo;Gate Days\u0026rdquo; in late May or early June; the last record I have found of this practice was from 1941.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/guide/resources/','title':"Resources",'section':"The Guide",'content':"Libraries #  Tired of suffocating in the mess at Moffitt? Keep running into the same old crowd at Eshleman? Maybe a trip to one of Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s 21 branch libraries and innumerable department, building, graduate school and other libraries might liven up your study time. Our Library Reviewer has checked out a few of them:\n Biosciences (40 Gianini) Underground, dark and spooky, with gray metal shelves. A good place to go if you are having trouble getting access to library computer terminals. Chemistry (100 Hildebrand) A huge echoing room with windows on three sides, all with views of surrounding trees. Somehow a not very attractive space, perhaps because of the harsh artificial lighting. East Asiatic (208 Durant) Formerly the Lawyers' Memorial Hall, it now contains by far the largest number of books of any branch\u0026mdash;more than half a million in 1989 (Moffitt had less than 200,000). This small, dark, mazelike room is crowded with ironwork balconies, bookshelves stretching to the high ceiling, desks with iron reading lamps, skylights, beautifully veined marble pillars and interesting hanging lamps. Four of these are shaped like ancient oil lamps, with glass bulbs shaped like flames and the Seal of the University of California on the bottom. Not recommended for studying, as it\u0026rsquo;s small and cramped, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly worth a look. Engineering (110 Bechtel) I always feel as if I\u0026rsquo;m about to put my foot through a floor or my hand through a wall of this library. Entomology (210 Wellman) Very quiet, with carrels near windows. The brightly colored bound journals give the shelves an oddly uniform look. Check out the exhibit of insects across the hall. Environmental Design (210 Wurster) Three floors of industrial-strength metal shelves and stairs, complete with two story high plaster angel and huge books full of pictures of buildings\u0026ndash;and you get to visit Wurster. What more can one ask? Forestry (260 Mulford) Quiet and small, with a few comfy chairs near windows. Recommended, because Mulford is such a funky building. Have a look at the row of identification planks in the hall outside; if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever wondered what kind of wood your desk is made of, here\u0026rsquo;s where to find out. Howison Philosophy Library (Moses) A pleasant, airy room with a high ceiling and tall windows, marble floor, nonfunctional fireplace, wood panelling, and an unnamed philosopher (presumably) on the wall to encourage you to higher efforts. Recommended if you don\u0026rsquo;t require comfy chairs. Library School (2 South Hall) Disappointingly normal in such an interesting building. Right at ground level, so you can distract yourself watching the people go by. Music (240 Morrison) If the librarian likes you, and you want to sing, you can take your books out onto the balcony. Optometry (490 Minor) Warm, bright, clean, new and dead quiet. The noisy optometrists head for the lounge, where there\u0026rsquo;s food and TV. Physical Education (Hearst Gym) You couldn\u0026rsquo;t ask for a better venue\u0026ndash;convenient to sunbathing and swimming. Social Welfare (216 Haviland) The original Howard interior was restored in 1986, according to the plaque; this large, cool blue room has comfy chairs in a circle and lovely desks with reading lights. The walls and ornate grilles are pale blue, with white pilasters and a delicate white ceiling decorated with allegorical medallions. This library had been slated to be destroyed in 1978 to make room for a biomedical sciences lab. Recommended.  Food and Drink #  Gone are the days when state law prohibited selling liquor less than one mile from campus, and students whose boardinghouses or dorms did not serve meals on weekends went to Bertola\u0026rsquo;s in downtown Oakland for the nearest cheap food. You can now get food, and even liquor, right on campus. Our restaurant reviewer has checked out what\u0026rsquo;s available in the way of ingestibles; we recommend the vending machines by the west entrance to Evans Hall only as a last resort.\nOn campus now are five official restaurants\u0026mdash;the Deli and Bear\u0026rsquo;s Lair in the ASUC complex, Ramona\u0026rsquo;s in Wurster Hall, the Terrace on top of Bechtel Engineering Center, and Pat Brown\u0026rsquo;s Grille just south of Koshland Hall. In addition, there are several cafÈ-type places around Sproul Plaza and Lower Sproul. All of these places except the Bear\u0026rsquo;s Lair are only open 9:00 to 3:00 on weekdays.\nThe Bear\u0026rsquo;s lair is five separate restaurants: Pappy\u0026rsquo;s, Pappy\u0026rsquo;s Pub, Taqueria Reyes, natural Sensations and the Coffee Spot. Pappy\u0026rsquo;s Pub is kind of fun-the bartenders are entertaining and they occasionally have good comedy nights. It is as good a bar as any in the immediate area. They have a large selection of domestic and imported draft beers, though surprisingly no Anchor Steam from right across the Bay.\nRamona\u0026rsquo;s used to be a dump with character and a piano, fifteen or so years ago. It\u0026rsquo;s still a cool space, though it could be a little better laid out. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect much from the food.\nThe Terrace Cafe, on top of Bechtel Engineering Center, serves the engineering community with drinks, coffees, snacks and sandwiches. It\u0026rsquo;s small inside but there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of room outside if it isn\u0026rsquo;t cold or raining.\nPat Brown\u0026rsquo;s Grille is well after my time. Its sunny courtyard is very popular. Minimal selection of snacks, sandwiches, drinks, salad bar. Pleasant indoor space.\nHangouts #  Every campus has its gathering place; over the years Berkeley has had several. First the steps in front of North Hall, then the courtyard between Stephens and Moses Halls, then Wheeler Steps, and finally Sproul Plaza, Lower Sproul and Dwinelle Plaza. Unofficially, the place to be these days is \u0026ldquo;Wheeler Beach,\u0026rdquo; the lawn just west of the building, overlooking Dwinelle Plaza.\nOne of my favorite places on campus is Faculty Glade. It is well located and well landscaped, and convenient to just about everything. It is sufficiently away from traffic noise, and sufficiently close to the Campanile bells. Despite its peacefulness, it is a great people-watching spot; virtually everyone goes by it sometime. On Tuesdays from 12 to 1 musicians gather near the Dryad to play Irish and old American folk tunes.\nThe Women\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club\u0026rsquo;s opulently landscaped garden along Strawberry Creek is a lovely spot but you have to expect to be overseen by the building\u0026rsquo;s inhabitants.\nThe tops of buildings are a good choice if you want a view, a breeze, or some privacy. The top of Wurster Hall seems to be no longer available, unfortunately, since it has been locked. The top of Evans Hall does not have a view, but it does have a pool and is usually deserted. The top of Campbell Hall contains a small observatory-I don\u0026rsquo;t know how difficult it is to get access to that roof, but I once had a memorable night there finding the North Star with an astronomy student. ESB has excellent balconies on the west side of each floor, with comfy chairs, couches and tables, lots of afternoon sun, and an excellent view of Observatory Hill, the campus, and (if you\u0026rsquo;re high enough) the Golden Gate- -the view is only enhanced by the fact that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to look at ESB.\nOne of the weirdest courtyards on campus is north of McLaughlin Hall and west of Hesse Hall\u0026mdash;good luck trying to get to it (hint: leave McLaughlin through the west door, look right and follow the winding stair). It is a circular courtyard covered with colored gravel formed into concentric circles. It is a truly bizarre space\u0026mdash;the poor little trees in planters just add to the surrealism. It is in fact the roof of a civil engineering lab built in 1962. Other recently-created areas include Bausch and Lomb Plaza, near Minor Hall, a well laid out but inaccessible spot now unfortunately occupied by a temporary building, and the new grassy space in front of Barker Hall, sunny and very popular\u0026ndash;you can\u0026rsquo;t beat the stunning view of Warren Hall.\nMy favorite outdoor campus place is Observatory Hill. Between 1886 and 1961 this area, just west of ESB, was the site of a cluster of wooden buildings known as the Students' Observatory until named after Armin Otto Leuschner, astronomy professor. In 1926 this facility had seven instruments, including a 6\u0026quot; equatorial refracting telescope. The astronomy department moved to Campbell Hall in 1959, and in 1965 a new Leuschner Observatory opened in Lafayette. Now only the ruin of one wooden building remains, saved from demolition by the giant wisteria in which it is encased.\nThe most popular indoor hanging-out place is the Morrison Reading Room in the Doe Library, where you can read bestsellers and the world\u0026rsquo;s daily papers and listen to records and CDs. A few less well-known pleasant spots include the Women\u0026rsquo;s Faculty Club common room, furnished by grateful refugees from the Oakland Hills fire of 1923, and the atrium of the small red brick building just north of Boalt Law School (the Zeta Psi fraternity until the 1920s\u0026ndash;observe the medallions between the arches\u0026ndash;now the paleontology department). This space is two stories high, with a translucent ceiling that lets in warm yellow daylight, and a whole wall decorated in neo-Lescaux. Nice comfy chairs, too.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing like a bomb shelter for a little peace and quiet. During World War II the University constructed several, in the basements of Haviland, Gianini, Wheeler, Durant, LeConte, and Stephens Halls, as well as other buildings. After the war some of these were designated fallout shelters and stocked with water and unopenable tins of biscuits.\nA Daily Cal article around that time described the odds of Berkeley surviving an atomic attack as \u0026ldquo;good,\u0026rdquo; and listed \u0026ldquo;six survival secrets for atomic attacks,\u0026rdquo; one of which was, \u0026ldquo;when the light flashes, duck.\u0026rdquo; A flap in the mid-1960s was stirred up over the shelters' inadequacy, when 200 students attempted to pack 52 Dwinelle, a designated shelter, to its capacity. I have never been in any of these shelters, but they are no doubt still there, and in use by those who know about them.\nUpdate November 2004:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a request from a reader for more information about bomb shelters; please drop me a line if you\u0026rsquo;d care to share your bomb shelter knowledge or experience.\nAnother reader tells me she distinctly remembers a small door with the word \u0026lsquo;Trolls\u0026rsquo; written on it; she thinks it was around Stephens or Eschleman, and recalls that there was no path or paving going to it. Please write and let me know if this rings a bell, and I will pass on the word.\nAnything you care to share will of course be credited to you if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to allow it to be shared or posted.\n Campus Treasures and Museums #  This campus has become home to an odd assortment of unusual and valuable items I cannot fully do justice to here. The largest collection of these is in the Bancroft Library, which contains, among other things, a Bible printed in 1466, a 4,000 year old papyrus, a Shakespeare First Folio, the diary of a member of the Donner Party, and the first gold nugget found at Sutter\u0026rsquo;s Mill.\nOn display in the Bancroft Library is the Plate of Brass, formerly known as the Drake Plate. On June 17, 1579, the Golden Hind reached a \u0026ldquo;faire and good Baye\u0026rdquo; on Drake\u0026rsquo;s voyage around the world. To commemorate this event, Drake\u0026rsquo;s log mentions that he planted a plate of brass on a pole. In 1936, an Oakland store clerk on a stroll near San Francisco Bay found such a plaque. He gave it to the University, which announced the discovery to the world in 1937. For 40years no test could disprove the authenticity of this artifact, although certain experts had their doubts. In 1977, two batteries of tests showed first that the zinc content of the plate is substantially higher than that of samples of 14th to 18th century brass, and is more like 19th or 20th century brass, and second that the edges of the plate appear to have been cut by machine, and the telltale marks disguised by hammering the edges. The plaque was renamed the Plate of Brass, the mystery of who made it and why was never solved, and the debate over which Baye Drake sailed into continues.\nEdmond O\u0026rsquo;Neill, class of 1879, taught chemistry here from 1879 to 1925, and left his estate to the University in 1933 for the purchase and care of an organ. Little did he know that that fund would provide the money for 14 rare and antique organs, making us the Organ Capitol of America. Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s music department also boasts a wonderful collection of other musical instruments including a Stradivarius and many medieval instruments like serpents and hurdy-gurdies. These come out of hiding every April during the department\u0026rsquo;s open house, when we get a rare opportunity to hear the organs and the early instruments, and to really hear the difference between an ordinary violin and a Strad.\nHearst Mining is the home of the James E. Birch Service. Birch was a Massachusetts schoolteacher who had struck it rich in the gold rush. He died in a shipwreck, after asking a fellow passenger to send his silver service to his wife in Massachusetts. In her will she left it to \u0026ldquo;the state where it was made.\u0026rdquo; The service is unique in design, containing such Western motifs as stagecoaches and prospectors.\nCases on the ground floor of the Campanile contain models, plans and photos of the Campanile and bells, including a wonderful portrait of Jane K. Sather, and artifacts of campus social life of bygone days. The lobby of Doe Library contains ever-changing exhibits of photos and print materials, often having to do with the history of the University or the Bay Area.\nOther artifacts can be seen in Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s many departmental museums and displays. Mulford Hall has its plank walls, Wellmn Hall has its insect cases, Tolman Hall has its old psychological testing instruments on the third floor near the psych offices. The biggest and most professional of these departmental museums is anthropology\u0026rsquo;s, formerly the Lowie Museum, now known with good reason as the Phoebe Hearst Museum. Its core is Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s original collection, which had originally been housed in the corrugated metal \u0026ldquo;Anthro Shack,\u0026rdquo; from 1899 to 1953 when it was moved to Kroeber Hall. It contains 695,000 artifacts, including the nation\u0026rsquo;s finest collections of ancient Egyptian and pre- Columbian Peruvian objects, and the world\u0026rsquo;s finest native Californian collection.\nMy personal favorite departmental museum is paleontology\u0026rsquo;s in the basement, first and second floors of ESB. This museum contains casts of many dinosaur bones including a tyrannosaurus rex skull and a huge wall-mounted hadrosaur, a real 30' long ichthysaur which was formerly displayed in Bacon Hall and was found in the Hearst Gym basement in 1939, giant sloth tracks, and mammoth dung. You will also meet the famous Smilodon, or sabertooth tiger, which is the California State Fossil. While you\u0026rsquo;re there, check out the geology department\u0026rsquo;s exhibit of gems on the third floor (did you know that quartz, agate, jasper, opal and amethyst are all the same mineral, SiO2?) and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to read the cartoons on the doors.\nThe weirdest museum on campus must be the one in Hearst Mining\u0026mdash;its exhibits on the second floor are interesting, but what are the huge unlabeled boulders on pedestals distributed around the first floor? Experimental traffic devices? The lobby of this building used to have a much more elaborate mining museum, complete with a model oil refinery and derrick that stretched to the skylight.\nThe Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Tour #  The connoisseur of technical delights has a lot to admire on this campus, whose engineering program was founded in 1875 by Frederick Godfrey Hesse, a veteran of the Prussian army. Since then it has been the scene of many advances. The materials for Hoover Dam and the Bay Bridge were tested here.\nThe oldest standing engineering building is Hearst Mining. If you walk along the retaining wall on the west side of this building, just behind a small wooden shed surrounded by marble slabs you will find the Hearst Mine\u0026ndash;actually an adit (a horizontal as opposed to a vertical shaft) named after Andrew C. Lawson, professor and eccentric. This is the man who once told a secretary to go to hell and, by way of coerced apology, later told her she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to go. He discovered the San Andreas Fault and, with admirable foresight, built an earthquakeproof house of reinforced concrete in 1908. This house survived the fire of 1923, but unfortunately its contents did not; in his absence his students moved everything to what they thought was a safe place and it was all destroyed. The adit was begun in 1916; in those days it was the training mine, and it extended as far east as Stern Hall; I understand that a portion has since collapsed, and the remainder is used for experiments that call for a vibration-free environment. The mine is often open to visitors during Engineers' Week\u0026mdash;wear your hard hat, please!\nThe third floor of Davis hall is Engineer Central-here you can visit the student chapter of ASCE and get a cool Cal Engineering T-shirt, see the concrete canoes which speed Berkeley on to victory in the yearly competition, and watch engineering labs in the central court through protective glass walls. Just southeast of Davis Hall is the Bent, symbol of the Tau Beta Phi engineering students' honor society.\nIn former days the most antisocial engineers and other nerds had their own club\u0026ndash;the Onyx Room, in the basement of Evans Hall, named after our server, which like all the other servers on campus at that time was given the name of a semiprecious stone. The exposed concrete was cool and damp even in summer, with clouds painted on one wall to alleviate the claustrophobia. The whole area has since been cleaned out in a sort of academic urban renewal; it is now The Web, a pink and green yuppie architectural nightmare which I can\u0026rsquo;t look on now without recalling the good old days.\nOutside the engineering area there are other things to see\u0026ndash;the two electromagnets displayed in the chemistry courtyard, the culvert whistlers in the breezeway between LeConte and Birge Halls, the telescopes on the roof of Campbell Hall\u0026hellip; but most intriguing of all to the adventurous technophile must be the 20 mile network of steam tunnels which extends all over the campus and as far as the Units, installed in 1904 and in some places unaltered since then. When I was much younger and stupider, some friends and I entered the tunnels and were driven back coughing and gasping. I later had more success in the tunnels under what is now Clark Kerr Campus. The steam you see rising from the vents in the roads, incidentally, is not leaking from the pipes; it is groundwater heated to boiling by the water inside them.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/guide/epilog/','title':"Epilog",'section':"The Guide",'content':"A Trip Down the Wurster Stairwell #  Most Environmental Design students, and some others, understand about Wurster Hall. Its design and construction were greeted with considerable verbiage on the part of the committee that created it:\n The solution [to the design problem] lay not in adherence to any single ideology or dogma, but rather in finding a reasonable path among a great array of conflicting and competing requirements\u0026hellip;giving the greatest importance to conflicting requirements and\u0026hellip;finding a way so that the status of each requirement and its conflicts was preserved\u0026hellip;. We sought not to resolve conflict but to preserve it. [The building was designed to] raise questions more than offer answers.\n Well, I have a few questions. What function are those sheet metal brackets in the corners of each stairwell landing supposed to fulfill? Why would anyone bother to tile miniscule portions of the walls and ceilings in the stairwell? What\u0026rsquo;s behind that wooden wall at the very bottom of the stairs? Why are there two doors into the stairs on the first floor? Can you really park a locomotive on the concrete sunshades? And why don\u0026rsquo;t they block the sun? Where was the brain of the person who installed clear plumbing pipes in the classroom ceilings? And, finally, the most important question of all-why is the courtyard on the second floor alwas locked? This courtyard contains two planters and two statues\u0026ndash;one a copy of the Venus de Milo and the other a modern version of an ancient goddess. Is it, perhaps, sacred to Aphrodite, opened only on holy days for ceremonies performed by white-robed virgins?\nWe begin our tour of the \u0026ldquo;College of the Environmentally Deranged\u0026rdquo; by taking the elevator to the ninth floor, which is as high as it goes. The elevator used to have graffiti-friendly walls; after a stint with vertical carpet, it is now paneled in the same thing \u0026ldquo;white chalkboards\u0026rdquo; are made of. The first stop would have been the top balcony, with its stunning view of the Campanile\u0026ndash;now, though, the doorknob is disabled. Fortunately, we can still go out onto the ninth floor balcony\u0026ndash;the view is almost as good, but in one direction rather than three. It\u0026rsquo;s still worthwhile to hike up to the 10 1/2th floor, past the former \u0026ldquo;Office of Pygmy Studies\u0026rdquo; to where the stairs end. Here is an ideal place for murals\u0026ndash;currently on exhibit are three black and white squares depicting a hand with a gun, a family turkey dinner, and two children walking down a road.\nWe proceed downstairs at a leisurely pace, observing the highlights of 27 years of student creativity. In this ever-changing landscape there currently seem to be fewer set pieces of \u0026ldquo;art,\u0026rdquo; like the \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; Tree of Life on the 9th floor (formerly one of two\u0026ndash;the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Tree has unfortunately vanished) or even the thermonuclear dancing pig on the seventh floor landing, and more illegible spray painted scrawl, alas. The slogans, in Chinese and German as well as English, range from the allegedly profound (\u0026ldquo;give love\u0026ndash;get love\u0026ndash;love!\u0026quot;) and the mildly amusing (\u0026ldquo;the BART police are tapping my phone\u0026rdquo;) to the downright obscure (\u0026ldquo;they said I was a fish/they dipped me into flour/and I became a dish/but I was not sweet and sour\u0026rdquo;) and completely rational (\u0026ldquo;Why are architecture students in such a badly designed building?? So they won\u0026rsquo;t copy\u0026rdquo;). On the whole, Wursterites seem to ponder politics, police brutality, aesthetics and art, as well as the usual University concerns (\u0026ldquo;roast the Regents on a spit\u0026rdquo;).\nYou may detour on the fifth floor to inspect the pillar where an Arch 1A student christened the building in 1964. The stairs branch off here, where we can observe a technical tour de force, the imposition of a 10\u0026rsquo;x10' 3-D map of a planned city onto the wall. Someone recently added a wonderful \u0026ldquo;CAL\u0026rdquo; stencil to this masterpiece. The city is near a two-story elegantly rendered man, also worth a look.\nFarther down from this is mostly more of the same, though the hedgehog doorstop, the flowers at each stair from the second to the first floor, and the \u0026ldquo;cactus girls\u0026rdquo; are notable. At the very bottom, under the stairs, was a manifesto that has been there at least a decade, as a memorial to freshman angst; it has recently been made into a black wall.\nIt is said that Berkeley is an anonymous, repressive, bureaucratic environment Wurster seems to be the one place where individual students feel allowed to break out.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/guide/bibliography/','title':"Bibliography",'section':"The Guide",'content':"Most of what is in this book I have seen, heard, experienced or read about in the Dail Cal.
