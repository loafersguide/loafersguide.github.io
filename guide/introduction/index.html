<article class=markdown><p>I started this book while attending graduate school at Berkeley in 1987, and completed the manuscript (to the extent that it is completed) in 1994, at which time I was living in the Midwest and was unable to show it to anyone who might have been interested. As I state in the following <a href=../prolog>Prolog</a>, a book like this is dated before it&rsquo;s begun &mdash; in the six years since I finished it several buildings have been demolished and several more of varying quality and prominence have been added to the campus. Departments have moved, services have disappeared and others have been created. And many of the places I mention, like the lobby of Hearst Mining and the Environmental Design library, are currently closed while undergoing renovation or seismic retrofit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping, though, that the information in this book will be useful and entertaining to people who either remember what the campus used to be like (or want to know) and people who will find that many of the things I describe can still be found on campus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to encourage anyone who has additional information to add, or who would like to take on the task of updating this manuscript, to contact me.</p>
<p>Enjoy the book, and have fun exploring our beautiful and historic campus.</p>
